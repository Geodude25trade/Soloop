The technology share chosen by Fleming Investment Management's Andrew Spencer, ARM Holdings, rose more than tenfold. However, those who picked companies which looked cheap on traditional valuation methods often found that their shares just got cheaper. The eclectic selection in The Observer's own portfolio was picked three years ago by secretaries throwing darts at the prices page of the Financial Times in an experiment to test whether successful investment owed more to luck than judgment. It includes a tea and coffee importer and the owner of the Hilton hotels. The experts won easily. Anyone who had invested \u00a31,000 in each of the eight shares chosen by our fund managers would have more than doubled their money and have a portfolio worth more than \u00a322,000, excluding dividends. Even without the spectacular ARM, the professionals would have scored a 32 per cent rise. The darts portfolio does not look too bad over a year: up 22 per cent. But it failed to show that, over the long term, random selections can do as well as carefully researched ones. Anyone who put \u00a31,000 into each share in December 1996 would now have just \u00a37,700, having completely missed the stock market surge. Verdict on the experts For the professional investors, ARM Holdings was the runaway winner in 1999. Andrew Spencer of Fleming Investment Management chose the company because of the prospects for growth in microprocessors for computers and mobile phones, but even he must be surprised at how quickly the technology - and ARM's share price - have taken off. Even after a four-for-one split the shares stand at more than \u00a330, and each new deal - Intel and Microsoft are among its partners - pushed them higher. The runner-up was David Manning of Foreign &amp; Colonial, who chose Computacenter. Floated in 1998, its shares have more than doubled as investors chased technology growth. In any normal year, a 136 per cent rise would have been enough to take the top slot, but Peter Knapton of Legal &amp; General, manages only third place with his selection of Marconi, as GEC is now called. Knapton's prediction that the new team of Lord Simpson, managing director, and finance director John Mayo would transform the group was borne out when it took the dramatic step of selling its defence business to British Aerospace. The remaining telecoms equipment business has been strengthened by acquisitions, and the shares have been comprehensively rerated. Two of the experts' choices could have become one as Airtours, picked by Kate Murphy of Henderson Investors, bid for First Choice, the selection of M &amp; G's John Hatherly. Both rose strongly in the first six months, lifted by the bid and by the realisation that Britain was not plunging into recession, only to drop back sharply as the European Commission blocked the deal and travel firms overestimated demand for millennium holidays. First Choice, buoyed by continued bid speculation, recovered while Airtours dropped. Waste management group Shanks, put Colin McLean of Scottish Value Management into fifth place, with a 10 per cent rise. The market has still to be convinced that it is worth McLean's target of 350p. In seventh place is Nick Mustoe of Prudential who chose Scottish &amp; Newcastle. Despite respectable results the market refuses to see value in the shares. He just pipped Graham Wood of Standard Life who also found himself out of step with the market as Stagecoach dropped nearly 39 per cent. It did carry on making acquisitions, as Wood had predicted, and sales and profits rose, but that was not enough to calm market jitters. ...and how the darts fared STAR of the darts portfolio was Aberdeen Asian Smaller Companies investment trust, where a recovery in the tiger economies helped its shares rise almost 80 per cent, although that puts it only just ahead of the 79p price when our secretaries' dart hit it. The next best was gas supplier International Energy Group, whose efforts at building its business continue to pay off. A 60 per cent rise during the year confirms it as the best performer over the three years of our experiment, in which time it has more than doubled in price. The 35 per cent rise in the shares of Capital Corporation was less exciting than it seems. The 85p price was the value of the offer from Stanley Leisure which finally put its shareholders out of their misery - when The Observer picked it, the price was 159p. Bid interest also played a part in the rise in shares of business travel group Hogg Robinson. UK Active Value, which targets underperforming companies, made a bid approach although, so far, there has been no other action. Midlands metal basher Ferrum Holdings had an eventful year. Dissident shareholders forced it to abandon an acquisition which it had hoped would transform the group, it had to fight off nominations to its board, and it returned to profit. Its shares did rise by 50 per cent although, at 3p, they are still firmly in the speculative camp. Intermediate Capital Group, which specialises in financing buy-outs and buy-ins, sought \u00a354 million in a rights issue to finance further expansion. Profits rose a healthy 14 per cent and the shares gained more than 8 per cent this year and almost two-thirds over the last three years. The portfolio had only two fallers this year, and both have dropped consistently since they were selected. Ladbroke renamed itself Hilton Group and formalised ties with its US counterpart. But it is still dogged by investors' belief that the hotel market is ripe for a recession, and its shares dropped by almost a fifth. Coffee and tea importer Langdons Foods was firmly in the doghouse. In a precarious financial position last year, it was rescued by Konrad Legg, who organised a \u00a31.35 million rights issue, consolidated its shares and changed its name to Coburg Group. Despite all that, the shares were still worth less than a quarter of their value at the start of the year. Having been trounced by the experts over three years, we have now decided to call a halt to the experiment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "business/2000/jan/02/efinance.personalfinancenews", "type": "article", "sectionId": "business", "sectionName": "Business", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:00:00Z", "webTitle": "Can the dot.com delirium survive the new century?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/02/efinance.personalfinancenews", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jan/02/efinance.personalfinancenews", "fields": {"bodyText": "Our obsession with the 'future' in the past 40 years has led to a gross overestimation of how our lives would have changed by the third millennium: we do not holiday on the moon, drive electric cars, or dine entirely on protein pills, live on or wear Lycra catsuits or live on Formica-built stations in middle space. The age has served up only one great unexpected technological breakthrough: the Internet. And there is little disputing that 1999 was the year of the Internet. It was directly or indirectly responsible for such phenomena as the world's richest man being admonished in court for running a monopoly, an eccentric Turkish ping-pong enthusiast becoming a worldwide cult figure and a high street retailer creating a \u00a35 billion business by giving away a product. The Internet has, for the past 12 months, been the El Nin\u00f5 of the financial world, wreaking unpredictable havoc on stock markets and turning the conventional business model on its head. The 'irrational exuberance', frowned on by the head of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, as long ago as 1996, continued unabated on Wall Street. When Greenspan sounded the alarm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at around 6,000. By the last day of trading in 1999, it was more than 11,500, powered almost entirely by the growth in high technology stocks. The sociological impact began to filter through, with the phenomenon of day trading - amateurs piling in to buying and then quickly selling shares over the Internet. Inevitably, perhaps, this net madness resulted in the first day-trading massacre, when Mark Barton went mad with a gun in a day trading room and then a brokerakge in Atlanta last July, killing 12 people and then himself. In a second and more serious bout of Internet fever, the UK began its first heady romance with what last year became known as the 'dot.com' culture. The overriding question for all businesses, investment banks, small shareholders, venture capitalists and entrepreneurs themselves, is how long can the 'rising-value-for-zero-profit' equation continue? At least 40 per cent of the current Internet businesses are expected to go belly-up in 2-5 years. In the US, the desperate desire for insight in to the future of this extraordinary boom has made a handful of successful analysts, led by Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, acquire almost mystical status. If Meeker's $15 million bonus is a measure of her fortune-telling abilities, her warning that around 90 per cent of Internet stocks are overvalued and that there will be a spring shake-out should be taken very seriously. What many experts wonder is how companies apparently running on thin air would react to a downturn in the US or even UK economy. We may have to wait to find out, with forecasters now predicting growth in the US economy into the spring, making it the longest sustained boom America has ever seen. Even as global markets closed for the millennium holiday in the western hemisphere, there was no sign of the investment community losing its enthusiasm. In the US, the home of the technology stocks, the volatile Nasdaq index hit 4,000 for the first time. Britain has very much taken its lead from the US in the high-tech arena - complete with the FTSE going to a crazy 6,900 at the year end, but as with film releases, we are somewhere between six months and two years behind our transatlantic neighbour. Two British Internet start-ups set the market alight last year. The first was Autonomy, the service which reads and extracts relevant information from documents, and Freeserve, Dixon's free Internet service which became the dominant service provider with 40 per cent of the market. Autonomy produced the success of the year - overtaking Freeserve in size to become the UK's biggest Net company in December. It was started by entrepreneur Mike Lynch with \u00a32,000 borrowed from a man in a pub. Listed on Easdaq at 370p in 1998, Autonomy shares are now worth around \u00a330. Freeserve's flotation price of 150p in July gave the company what many analysts thought was unrealistically high value. . However, the shares soared to more than 550p, confounding critics but troubling those who know that all these shares will feel gravity's pull eventually. On Christmas Eve the company announced it would replace its 31-year-old chief operating officer, Mark Danby, with Frank Keeling, a director at AOL Europe. This raises the possibility that it might consider charging for its services this year. It is ironic that as 1999 drew to a close, British Airways, a company which Freeserve has overtaken in size of market capitalisation, announced it was stripping out its Internet sales into a separate company; one more example of a traditional company hoping to add value with a dot.com added to its name. Business in 2000 will be about more of the same but with greater discernment, one hopes. The challenge is to pick winners and losers in the virtual economy. One of the most significant unfinished events of the past 12 months was the Microsoft anti-trust trial. On 6 November Judge Penfield Jackson announced that Microsoft had acted as a monopoly. The question for the new year is whether the remedy will be to break up the company. Bill Gates, its founder, may already be thinking along these lines - Microsoft's astonishing growth cannot be sustained as demand for PC operating systems plateaus. It is possible, of course, that Gates' kingship of the information superhighway will be usurped by Linus Torvalds, another thirtysomething who generated, and then gave away, the Linux operating system which spawned two of America's most successful stock market flotations last year: Red Hat and Linux VA. The new year will certainly see a swarm of alliances between e-commerce and mobile telephony, as we move from a wired world to a wireless world and m-commerce becomes the new buzzword. One of the most significant but under-reported events of 1999 was Oftel's decision to open up BT's hold on the 'local loop' - lines between homes and telephone exchanges. The result will be competitors offering fast - and cheap, one assumes - Internet access to the home. To counter this, and the mobile revolution, BT will launch its flat-rate permanent Internet connection service and we will see the first large-scale ADSL (high-speed Internet connections) services installed in living rooms. The result will be an explosion in 'always on' Internet access, and the changes in consumer behaviour that will bring. On the international front the tensions between the US and the EU over intellectual property law and data privacy will become more acute. The shadow over the sustainability of the Internet boom will not stop the stream of defections from traditional business into online commerce and, unless there is an economic catastrophe, we can expect several dozen more twenty- and thirty-something millionaires to be created in the next 12 months. But, as the old adage has it, while the short term impact of the Internet has almost certainly been drastically overestimated, the long-term impact may have been gravely underestimated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "money/2000/jan/02/personalfinancenews.business2", "type": "article", "sectionId": "money", "sectionName": "Money", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:00:00Z", "webTitle": "Stars shone brightly, but it was a gloomy year for most", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/jan/02/personalfinancenews.business2", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2000/jan/02/personalfinancenews.business2", "fields": {"bodyText": "There will always be winners and losers in the stock market. That much is not in dispute. But the degree to which the gap between climbers and fallers has opened up over the past 12 months is unprecedented. A handful of stock market stars saw their prices soar, but the share prices of most companies actually went down. Amid all the gleeful reporting of stock market records over the past few weeks, this elementary fact is worth repeating and holding on to: for virtually all of 1999, the majority of share prices were lower than they had been at the start of the year. But the sheer scale of the increase in prices of those shares that rose was enormous - so enormous that the indices of stock market prices as a whole were hauled upwards. The figures for the three best-performing sectors are staggering: between the end of 1998 and 21 December 1999, the value of the IT hardware sector rose by 654 per cent. Over the same period, the rise in information technology stocks was 184 per cent; software and computer services increased 144 per cent. Three further sectors - steel and metals, mining, and electronic and electrical equipment - managed increases of 100 per cent or more. But at the other end of the scale, tobacco and water companies fell by more than a third. Food producers, electricity companies and household products were all down by a fifth or more. Analysis by Legal &amp; General showed dramatically how the spread of price performances has been stretched over 1999. Look at all companies worth more than \u00a32 billion at the beginning of December 1999. Then plot how their prices have moved since the start of that year. In this league table, the top quarter of shares rose 28 per cent or more; the bottom quarter fell 33 per cent or more. So the spread between these two landmarks - the least successful winners and the most successful losers - was 61 per cent. Compare that with 1998: the figure then was a more modest 42 per cent; in 1994, it was just 21 per cent. The league table for the share price performances of individual FTSE 100 constituents reflects perfectly the pattern of the year: at the top are companies such as ARM Holdings, Sage Group and Colt Telecom. (ARM's value multiplied twelvefold between 1 January and 22 December. On Christmas Eve alone, it went up by more than \u00a33 to \u00a340.50 and as soon as the markets reopened after Christmas, it jumped a further 114p.) At the bottom are the likes of Boots, Great Universal Stores, Rentokil and Associated British Foods. Does this give any clues about investment strategy in 2000? Very little. No one knows when the technology bubble will burst. But just as the stellar performance of a few stocks lifted market indices in 1999, indices could fall in 2000 but leave share prices of more stolid companies unscathed. In a crash, it may be only a minority of stock prices that suffer. Investing in companies that have been eclipsed over the past 12 months might appear rather clever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "money/2000/jan/02/personalfinancenews.business1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "money", "sectionName": "Money", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:00:00Z", "webTitle": "Take the bull market by the horns", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/jan/02/personalfinancenews.business1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2000/jan/02/personalfinancenews.business1", "fields": {"bodyText": "Emily Bell Business Editor On day two of the new millennium, the temptation is to advise everyone to avoid the stock market in the next 12 months because It Can't Go On. But forecasters who have stuck to this entirely rational line of reasoning for the past three years have missed one of the great bull runs this - sorry, last - century. Retreating from cowardice, a more canny approach is to tip one relatively safe stock and one more risky one. In the blue-chip corner we have Granada. The leisure services and media company will have a very active year. A high share value is attached to strength of management - Granada's top two, Gerry Robinson and Charles Allen, are exemplars. It will be looking to sort itself into a fit state for demerger, with a major leisure acquisition and at least one other major media acquisition or partnership. The shares, which underperformed in the last three months, should be a buy at their year-end level of 624p. Point a gun in a crowded room of dot.com initial public offerings, and you would hit the jackpot. That was the rule for 1999. Picking any technology stocks for 2000 is fraught with the knowledge that some will, again, see spectacular gains, but that many will fall to earth with a sickening thud. But a punter with surplus cash might do worse than look at Axon. This company does the dull bits of e-commerce, consulting on the implementation of the weightless economy. It doubled in value last year - only a modest gain for this sector. But as real companies need the nuts and bolts for e-business, firms such as Axon - current price, 592p - should prosper. Heather Connon Investment Editor A series of profit warnings, a management in limbo and fears of the threat - not the opportunity - of the Internet meant that Reed Elsevier (465p) missed out on the boom in media stocks late last year. That will all change in 2000. New chief executive Crispin Davis made it clear in the December trading statement that Reed must catch up on the Internet boom and will spend freely to do so. More flesh will be put on that strategy in February, which should be the catalyst for a thorough rerating. Housebuilders had a brief flurry of excitement at the start of 1999 but reverted to a depressed state as interest rates rose. The depression is excessive: housebuilding shares are now discounting a bloodbath worse than that seen after the late Eighties boom. Yet there are no signs that the market is overheating, and interest rates are likely to peak at less than 8 per cent, just half the level they reached after the last boom. Many housebuilders look attractive, and McCarthy &amp; Stone, which specialises in sheltered housing for older people, is more so than most. Its shares, at 247p, stand at less than 10 times next year's expected earnings, earnings growth of at least 10 per cent is expected in the next three years and its big land bank is relatively cheap. Paul Farrelly City Editor Diageo, the world's largest spirits firm created from the merger of Guinness and Grand Metropolitan, was one of the FTSE-100 index's biggest disappointments in 1999. Its shares defied pundits' predictions of a rally by plumbing new depths from the spring onwards. Fears of overstocking for the millennium, particularly in Diageo's key US market, have done much of the damage. Analysts' profit downgrades, however, have been modest and Diageo's focus on shareholder value may yet see a demerger of Pillsbury, Burger King or even brewing. We are in good company in rating Diageo, now hovering around \u00a35, as a recovery buy. In the banking sector, Alliance &amp; Leicester has been through turbulent times. And there will be fun and games in the new year if ousted chief executive Peter White washes its dirty linen before an industrial tribunal. At \u00a38 now, A&amp;L shares have lost all the bid premium at the time of White's removal. The former building society is up for sale, however, and is certainly a buy. Our favourite, though, is one of banking's jewels, Abbey National, which - at below \u00a310 - has lost more than 40 per cent of its value since May. The bidding frenzy for NatWest aside, Abbey is one of the sector's great prizes. Ben Laurance Contributing Editor Engineering shares have taken a battering over the past two years, but started to recover recently. At current levels they continue to offer good value, measured by likely earnings and yield. If you are looking for a company which is sensibly managed with a good spread of businesses and which could benefit if the value of sterling falls, go for TI Group. At 460p, the shares represent secure value which should hold up reasonably well if the price of more fashionable stocks tumble. The takeover of Asda by Wal-Mart had a major impact on retail share valuations in the latter half of last year. The market was panicked into believing that profit margins across the sector were about to be slashed. If you believe these fears are overdone, look at Boots. The shares topped \u00a310.50 in the second half of 1998. That was unjustifiably high. But at around 600p now, the price has fallen too far. Watch out for Boots' trading statement this month. That should underpin the prediction that profits will hold up far better than the current share price reflects. Unless you believe that the established retail industry is about to collapse, Boot shares offer little downside and plenty of scope for appreciation. Oliver Morgan Industrial Correspondent If you think the market's on the verge of another crash, there's nothing as defensive as utilities. Scottish &amp; Southern is viewed by many as the pick of the sector. With the shares at 493p now, the City is looking for an end year target of 730p. Attractions include: further cost cutting, possible growth of Scottish Hydro's 25 per cent and 6 per cent market shares in Scotland, and England and Wales respectively and sales opportunities from Southern Electricity's 2.5m customer base. S&amp;S's management is highly regarded and well up to coping with the relatively benign review meted out by regulator Callum McCarthy. For a more bullish growth stock, try Marconi, the renamed GEC. The telecoms equipment group's shares may have surged 80 per cent recently to 1094p now, but it still offers a chance of further gains from the fad for technology without the volatility of a dot.com company. And what do the professionals predict this time? For the experts, new technology and the Internet are a common theme - so much so that David Manning of Foreign &amp; Colonial has even managed to cite it in choosing one of our most traditional companies, Great Universal Stores (343p). Manning believes the Net will revolutionise business but he is deterred by the high valuations of the new technology stocks. Instead, he plumps for mail order giant Gus which 'already has the skillset and structure to reap great benefits from the e-commerce revolution'. He admits that the task of turning it around is great, but says its mail order business is already adept at sorting and distributing goods, and its Experian information division is the world's largest credit assessor. Graham Wood of Standard Life also looks for a technology stock going cheap, and alights on Cable &amp; Wireless (1047p), one of the few telecoms operators not to go through the roof last year. Wood believes 2000 could be different. He thinks it will sell its Hong Kong Telecom stake, focusing attention on the low valuation of the remainder, and thinks it could be a bid target. Andrew Spencer, of Fleming Investment Management, who ran away with the prize last year with his choice of ARM Holdings, is sticking with the winning formula of technology stocks. This time, he plumps for Autonomy ($48.70), a British company quoted on Easdaq, the European high-tech market. Floated only six months ago, its knowledge management software is aimed at saving time and money by analysing documents and picking out the most important facts. Autonomy's shares have already risen almost twentyfold since its debut. Kate Murphy of Henderson Investors and John Hatherly of M &amp; G both chose travel companies last year, and this year they both plump for biotech firms. Murphy's choice is Phytopharm (435p), a leader in producing cures for serious diseases using botanicals, or extracts from medicinal plants. Murphy believes it will produce remedies for conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, eczema and hepatitis in coming years, in partnership with pharmaceutical giants such as Pfizer. Hatherly opts for Celltech Chiroscience (529p), the newly-merged biotechnology company. Hatherly believes the fashion for high-tech companies will spill over into the biotech sector, and thinks Celltech's combination of 'a string portfolio of products, strong management and a well-financed business' will make it a winner. Max Ward, who retires as head of the UK desk at Baillie Gifford in April, chooses as his valedictory share Bovis, the housebuilder (308p). He expects its performance to be dull in the first half of the year but, as it becomes clear that interest rates will not have to rise to usurious levels, profits will rise faster than expected and shares could enjoy a dramatic re-rating. Jim Wood-Smith of broker Greig Middleton is in the unusual position of not now knowing whether his selection will by March have more than doubled its size. He opts for Bank of Scotland (719p), which is bidding \u00a325 billion for NatWest in competition with its Scottish neighbour, Royal Bank of Scotland. Wood-Smith thinks that, if it wins at that price, the deal will be very good for BoS shareholders. And if it loses, it can go back to being a very good bank - or an attractive takeover target for someone else. Colin McLean of Scottish Value Management plumps for Cordiant Communications, the advertising group (291p), which he thinks is benefiting from a pick-up in advertising activity. A large portion of money raised by new Internet companies in the US has been spent on awareness advertising. Europe is now joining that trend and Cordiant is in a prime position to reap rewards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "business/2000/jan/02/observerbusiness.theobserver", "type": "article", "sectionId": "business", "sectionName": "Business", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:07Z", "webTitle": "Only two cheers for capitalism, I'm afraid", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/02/observerbusiness.theobserver", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jan/02/observerbusiness.theobserver", "fields": {"bodyText": "It was the millennium before Christ's birth which set the scene for subsequent economic history - the twin themes of trade and exploration. The Phoenicians were at it well before the ancient Greeks of the classical period. The Greeks, in the fifth century BC under Pericles, showed what could be done aesthetically and economically with public works. And their word for household (oikos) gave us 'economics'. Then came the Romans. When you think of the public works, the roads, the aqueducts, the sanitation and central heating that were available in the centuries around the beginning of the first millennium, the crimes of those who subsequently brought 'the Dark Ages' hardly bear thinking about. Around the middle of the second millennium, trade and exploration got going again. We in Britain associate all this with the Elizabethan merchant venturers; but the Spanish, the Dutch and the Portuguese were all scouring the world for gold, precious metals and spices. Exploration was not only a question of going around the world and paving the way for what is now known as 'globalisation'. It was also internal, with the astronomical and scientific research associated with the Renaissance and after. But the exploration of the globe was assisted by the navigational discoveries being made at home. The year 1776 brought not only America's declaration of independence from Britain, but also Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. For a book that was published in the very early stages of the industrial revolution, Smith's work did remarkably well to become a bible for subsequent centuries. It is best known for all that stuff about 'the invisible hand', and the pursuit of private interest also benefiting the public. But one of its main purposes was also to widen economic policy goals from mercantilism (piling up trade surpluses and gold reserves) to emphasising production and employment generally. Even in those days - 75 years before the Great Exhibition of 1851 and the apotheosis of Britain's industrial might, Smith was warning of the need for this country to adapt itself to 'the mediocrity of its circumstances'. The letters to the Times about Britain's relative economic decline were in evidence well before the beginning of the century to which we have just bidden farewell. For many people, the trouble with Smith's invisible hand was that it might stitch you up. Bismarck, worried about Marxist stirrings, introduced a social safety net into Germany, and the Liberals and the newly-formed Labour Party followed suit in this country. The big economic experiment of the last century of the second millennium was of course Communism, and it proved a resounding failure. Fear of Communism was one of the factors influencing those who sought to make capitalism work better during the twentieth century. Keynes thought 'capitalism, wisely managed, can probably be made more efficient for attaining economic ends than any alternative system yet in sight, but [that] in itself it is in many ways extremely objectionable'. It certainly is in many ways extremely objectionable. I should go so far as to say that Communism has failed but capitalism has not yet entirely succeeded. This was what, in their way, the protesters in Seattle were trying to say in November. Keynes and his followers gave us demand management to alleviate the 'boom and bust' proclivities of the domestic business cycle; and agreed rules for the international trade and payments system, so that judicious domestic policies should not be foiled by the international beggar-my-neighbour behaviour that characterised the inter-war years. Thanks to the Keynesian legacy, for all the problems caused by the energy crises of the mid-Seventies and early Eighties, things never got so out of hand in the world economy as they had in the Thirties. It was a close-run thing, however, as demonstrated by the monetarist flirtation with the abandonment of demand management. It is, incidentally, perfectly consistent to share all the concerns about the beggar- my-neighbour policies that prompted the eventual setting up of the World Trade Organisation and still to question the obsession with the rapid removal of all barriers to capital and trade flows that has recently marked the US Treasury's position. The Smoot-Hawley tariff law of 1930, and its impact in spreading the impact of the US depression internationally, was one of the most economically damaging acts of the twentieth century. But there is a difference between genuine protection and trade war; and I already detect a softening of the international financial establishment's previous position: that capital controls are undesirable in almost all circumstances. But it took the Asian economic crisis to extract this reluctant recognition. In addition to Keynes, another great twentieth century economist whose name keeps recurring is Joseph Schumpeter. Schumpeter was no Keynesian. I recently asked J. K. Galbraith, who sat at the feet of both, whether it was true that Schumpeter hated Keynes. 'That's an understatement,' he replied. 'Schumpeter used to wander around Harvard muttering sarcastically \"Keynes is God, Keynes is Allah\".' Schumpeter was the first apostle of the creative destruction school of capitalism, which is all the rage in the US again. Schumpeter just loved capitalism and 'the competition from the new commodity, the new technology, the new source of supply, the new type of organisation - competition which commands a decisive cost or quality advantage and which strikes not at the margins of the profits and the outputs of the existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives'. Schumpeter preached 'the civilisation of inequality and of the family fortune'. Ironically he feared (in 1949) that 'this civilisation is rapidly passing away' and that capitalism might end up socialising itself. He would have loved the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions, revolutions which appear to have been largely accepted by New Labour.

Two of these, Jupiter and Saturn, form a conjunction every 20 years: the ebb and flow of this Jupiter-Saturn cycle marks changes in social and economic behaviour. The May 2000 cycle is particularly special as it occurs within days of turning points being reached in other major cycles. As the planets involved are slow-moving, some dramas are already unfolding. Taurus is associated with the farming industry, where radical change and reform are becoming necessary. The construction industry is also likely to be affected. But the greatest effect is probably to be felt by the banks. Their problems seem centred on dealing with electronic fraud, with the danger of some banks collapsing. Property prices in the UK are also likely to be affected by this rare planetary line-up, with some properties in the South East scaling dizzier heights. However it may be far more common for properties to lose value. Interest rate rises form only part of the story. A shifting water table, combined with disturbed weather patterns, looks set to bring subsidence problems. Anyone living near water or at the foot of hills should be especially vigilant and prepare for possible flooding. It is also possible that 2000 will see a rise in negative equity. As the summer passes, Jupiter and Pluto move to oppose one another, and this sets the stage for tension in the travel and communications industries. Anticipate mergers in these fields as smaller companies find themselves unable to compete in global price wars. Four solar eclipses take place in 2000. Between them they affect more than half the FTSE 250 companies. As eclipses mark endings and beginnings, anticipate a bumpy ride on the markets in 2000, especially around 5 February and 1 and 31 July. AND SIGN BY SIGN Aries 21 March - 20 April With so many planets focused in a prominently financial area of your solar chart, May promises to be an exciting month. This is the time to invest in the local small craftsman and/or to do some self-investment. But cashflow problems could stunt fast growth if your business plan is unsound. July could be especially difficult. New strategies have to be implemented in August. Investments bring gains in the autumn, when a proposed merger increases the value of your portfolio. As the year closes, changes in your domestic circumstances release capital for yet another venture. Taurus 21 April - 20 May You could be both shocked and disillusioned by events in the first six months of 2000. It is clear that major changes have to be made both to your lifestyle and to your investment strategy. You may resist change, but it is inevitable. The 31 July solar eclipse marks the end of one financial phase. Making the most of new opportunities requires that you develop new information sources. Put energy into this and check the integrity of all information. There is potential for real gains in the latter half of the year - especially if commodities are involved. November offers gains through overseas investment. Gemini 21 May - 20 June During the first few months of the year you are reminded of the need to consider making provision for care in your old age. This means reviewing pensions, insurance policies and healthcare cover. Tackle these issues before the solar eclipse of 1 July, which sees a fresh start in your financial affairs. Increased responsibility at work brings some cash reward by September. The extra income is swallowed up by a new investment programme recommended to you in late July. This new financial regime ensures that you conclude 2000 in a better state of financial health than you began it. Cancer 21 June - 22 July The solar eclipse of 5 February marks the end of a financial partnership. This is not bad news and heralds a new start. The planetary line-up for May brings cash-related fireworks that threaten to unsettle you. You find yourself undertaking major financial reconstruction in July. This could involve remortgaging or even a house move. During the summer you are advised to pay closer attention to long-term savings schemes. By early October you open yet another account. The solar eclipse of 25 December marks yet another financial gear change. This could be the start of more property or business investing. Leo 23 July - 22 August Keep a tight rein on your money during January if you want to avoid a financial crash of one kind or another in February or again late in May. The year is not all bad news, and financial gain is probable. An eclipse in your sign on 31 July heralds a new financial partnership. The two great wealth-giving planets, Jupiter and Pluto, could leave you walking a financial tightrope during the early autumn. You can limit high drama by listening to advice from your partner. Moderate your speculative tendencies and invest in well- established companies to ensure a safe ending to the year. Virgo 23 August - 22 September Finances receive a boost in February. But by March you find that the extra income is being eaten up by increased expenditure. Cost pruning is necessary in April. There are further shocks in the early part of May, but the last week of that month brings a reversal in your fortunes. You find yourself on the ground floor of a new business venture. Growth will be slow but sure. All your resources are stretched to the limits in September, but by mid-October you sense that rewards are on the way. Financial rewards reach you by early December and ensure a good ending to the year. Libra 23 September - 22 October Embarking on a financial fitness programme gets 2000 off to a good start for you. By the 5 February eclipse, you need to have a clear idea of your goals. This could require pruning costs in March and April. In May you are asked to consider a new financial partnership. Throughout June and July you make good gains. Budget for increased costs in August. Financial restructuring is again necessary in September. The reward is reduced tax liability. A money crisis in October finds you temporarily at odds with a partner. Investing in a new property is under discussion as the year closes. Scorpio 23 October - 22 November It may not be until 2001 that you are finally free of one financial obligation. But it seems less of a burden in 2000 than it has been. From February onward you are aware of improvements in your financial affairs. New developments in May find you seizing opportunities that others overlook. But these stretch your cashflow to the limit through to mid-October. A turning point is reached then. Others look to you to resolve a financial dilemma in November. This earns you more respect and could lead to a lucrative offer being made in early December. Sagittarius 22 November - 22 December Your financial fortunes could change dramatically in 2000. Facts and figures demand your attention from the first few days of the year. By February the ebb and flow of your bank account is changing pattern. Meetings with accountants and financial advisers take extra time that month. Extra work in May and June increases income. The extra cash could boost a pension. More income can be generated at the start of the next academic year, when others offer to pay you for demonstrating your skills. This second source of income develops quickly and could even change your tax status before the end of the year. Capricorn 23 December - 19 January The year 2000 promises to be one of steady growth for you. That does not mean it is boring. In February you decide to pull out of one financial partnership. This releases cash and energy for work in new areas. Your attention is drawn to overseas investments in April and May. Tax problems demand attention from late August. A financial adviser plays an important role in September. Christmas finds you considering a new financial partnership. During the last few days of the year you consider making a large investment. Once again your adviser plays a key role. Aquarius 20 January - 18 February The solar eclipses of 5 February and 31 July signal dramatic changes in your fortunes. View these as the endings of chapters. The new chapters beginning offer greater financial security. You could feel unsettled during the last few days of May, when others seek your long-term commitment to a new project. Once you have made appropriate adjustments, you find that your cashflow improves during late August and the early autumn. A review of your savings is necessary in early December. Realising a dream could be more expensive than you think. Depleting earlier gains may not be wise. Pisces 19 February - 20 March The financial affairs of those closest to you have a dramatic impact on your life this year. Six weeks into the start of the year you sense that you need to make your own needs known. By May you are ready for a new beginning and in June you find the commercial opportunity that has been eluding you for some time. A new product or business venture brings fast rewards during the summer, but there are difficulties from mid-October. Others run themselves short of capital. It may prove difficult to balance the books as the year draws to a close.

In either incarnation - as thrusting young democrat or ageing autocrat crippled by strokes, heart failure and depression - the man who dominated his nation for eight turbulent years showed that he had lost none of his talent for wrong-footing the opposition. The timing of his resignation announcement on New Year's Eve was a political masterstroke. Had Boris hung on to the bitter end in June, when his second term as President runs out, the fate of his chosen successor, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, risked becoming inextricably linked to the wavering fortunes of the brutal onslaught in Chechnya, one that the Chechen rebels show every sign of resisting. By handing over the nuclear suitcase and other trappings of presidential power to Putin now, not only have those elections been brought forward to March but Putin is effectively in charge of staging them. This means he has plenty of time to tame the already obsequious media, and ensure that his image dominates every nightly news bulletin. It should be a shoo-in for the 46-year-old KGB operative. Sensing this, Western leaders are already preparing to assure the new master of the Kremlin of their personal support. Tony Blair got in first, after a 45-minute warm-up session from the British Ambassador, who once boasted a personal friendship with the controversial media tycoon and Yeltsin crony, Boris Berezovsky. But exactly who is Blair supporting? The man who described the legitimate government of Chechnya as 'vermin', vowing to hunt them down, even if they were hiding in the lavatory? Or the taciturn Judo black belt who poses as the 'strong hand' that a weakened Russia so desperately needs? Or the pragmatic pro-market reformer that the West can at last 'do business with?' Putin's first moves as acting President have given them some clues: flying down to Chechnya to give engraved daggers to his soldiers. Putin's war front in Grozny is his main election front as well, and if the reconquest of Chechnya fails, so too will his election. Before he left Moscow he handed an amnesty from prosecution to Yeltsin and his family, long mired in allegations of corruption. Yeltsin may have apologised for his misdeeds, but he will not be prosecuted for them. For the crony capitalist elite that runs the country, this signals business as usual. If this is what the Pentagon means by a steady hand, it is a long way from democracy. In truth, the script for President-elect Putin was already written by the failure of the 'shock therapy' economists to do much more than destroy the Soviet Union's military- industrial infrastructure, and erode ordinary people's bank savings. It was the democratic coalition that supported Yeltsin when he made his stand on the tank in the failed August 1991 coup, and then opened the Pandora's box of nationalism, when the dream of democracy crumbled in their hands. Now it has handed the country a President who will pursue Russia's national interest ruthlessly. That interest is volatile and could turn against the West as easily as it launches a new war in the North Caucasus. There is still a chance that Putin could turn out to be the moderate, pragmatic, stable leader Russia has been yearning for. The odds at the moment are against it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/terrorism", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:10Z", "webTitle": "India's hard line on terrorism in chaos over hijack surrender", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/terrorism", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/terrorism", "fields": {"bodyText": "The 'nice' hijacker, the tall, elegant one, dressed entirely in black beneath his balaclava, paused for an instant at the gate of the aircraft. 'Bye, bye,' he said, speaking in English. 'See you again soon.' And then he was gone. With that casual farewell, eight days of incarceration within the economy-class cabin of a hijacked Indian Airlines passenger jet came to an end on Friday afternoon. But for the 155 stunned hostages aboard, it took several more minutes for the realisation to sink in that this was no trick or a cruel joke by the captors, whose moods would swing from violent rage to friendly banter in an instant. Two days after India's Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, decided New Delhi had no choice but to swallow its pride and give in to the hijackers, the deal was done. India's Foreign Minister, Jaswant Singh, was reduced to the role of a prison warden. On Friday afternoon, he flew to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar on the same aircraft as three radicals jailed for their part in the uprising against New Delhi's rule over Kashmir. The three prisoners were handed over, and they and the five gunmen raced away in pick-up trucks. Within an hour, the hostages were bundled aboard two waiting Indian passenger jets and flown from Kandahar to New Delhi. By 9pm Indian time, they were home - or at least the 154 Indian passengers were. One Swiss hostage was whisked away on a private jet, the other 21 foreign nationals aboard were bundled away by diplomats. Yesterday Singh said their tormentors, and the three militants released by India, had left Afghanistan for the Pakistani city of Quetta. Although the five hijackers have not been identified, Singh said they were Pakistanis, as were most of the 36 jailed militants whose release they originally sought. He also said they could not hope to escape indefinitely in Pakistan. Once New Delhi begins to recover from the sizeable dent in its national pride, the role of both Pakistan and Afghanistan in the hijacking affair is bound to come under greater scrutiny. For the moment, however, Singh was seeking shelter behind the euphoria that greeted the arrival of the hostages in Delhi on Friday night. 'Since the beginning, our priority was the early termination of the hijacking, safe return of the passengers and crew, and preservation of national interest,' he said. 'I do believe this priority has been achieved.' Unshaven and unwashed, the hostages staggered out of the airport into a throng of friends and family and television cameras. 'It was OK, the treatment was very good. The hijackers were very nice to us,' said Bharti Gupta. Gupta was returning from a honeymoon in Nepal when she boarded the Delhi-bound IC-814 in Kathmandu on Christmas Eve. Still bedecked in the heavy gold jewellery of an Indian bride, she would land in the Indian city of Amritsar, the city of Lahore in Pakistan, and then Dubai, before landing in Kandahar on Christmas morning. But with the shades drawn, and male hostages blindfolded, it would take several days for all of the captives to learn where they were. That information trickled out over the next few days in whispered conversations with the pilot. The hijackers insisted on regularly moving the passengers - although they let couples sit together - to prevent them plotting against them. Even after their arrival in Delhi, few knew that their captors had killed one of their hostages - an Indian bridegroom - slitting his throat at Amritsar and tossing his corpse out of the plane at Dubai. Only a few passengers were given permission to enter the business-class cabin where the gunmen had camped out, and where their Indian victim had bled to death. No one dared to ask about the blood stains on the seats. They also kept silent during the second day at Kandahar when, amid much commotion, the hijackers' weapons stocks suddenly grew. Instead of a few handguns and kitchen knives, the gunmen now had a mighty arsenal, which arrived on board in three duffle bags. Yesterday Singh told reporters that the hijackers' upgraded cache of weapons, which could have been unloaded from the cargo hold, contained AK-47s, Israeli-made Uzis, grenades and other explosives. But most of those aboard had no idea that their tormentors had rearmed, or that efforts were under way to buy their release. 'We felt abandoned by everybody. We did not know if they were negotiations or not,' said F. Jougal, a French doctor aboard. 'We did not know in the morning if we would see the year 2000.' Their universe had shrunk to the stink of the economy- class cabin, where they existed on a diet of mainly Afghan bread and oranges. There was barely enough food, and even less water - sometimes less than two glasses a day. On Friday, their meals consisted of one glass of milk and three biscuits each. Nevertheless, several hostages admitted there were light-hearted moments. With the chief hijacker closeted in the cockpit, where he conducted negotiations by radio with the Indian officials who flew to Kandahar on Monday, the human cargo was turned over to the man in black. For the most part, he proved a merciful jailer, and some of the hostages even gave him a nickname: Burger. He played with the two children aboard, and reassured the anxious women, wrapping up a shawl to give to one Indian woman on her birthday on 27 December. But there were moments of terror, too. When one of the passengers, an Indian man who was an accomplished mimic, provoked too much laughter with his imitations of Burger, another gunman stepped through the curtain from business class to slap him into terrified silence. Several of the hostages said their jailers' mood-swings intensified in the final two days of captivity, when talks to win their release faltered. The Indian negotiators at Kandahar were haggling over the number of jailed militants to be exchanged for the 155 on board the aircraft. For their part, the hijackers were constantly interrupting the negotiations to consult people at Kandahar - who were not Taliban officials, Singh said. On Thursday, the talks broke down completely. Inside the plane, the hostages had no idea of what was exercising their captors. But there was no mistaking the hijackers' anger. 'When the deal suddenly crashed, they said they would begin killing us,' said Kanika Narthani. 'But things just suddenly happened. In a split second they were very happy.' Finally, at about 2am Indian time on Friday, soldiers arrived at a jail in the Kashmiri summer capital of Srinagar to take custody of Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, the sole Indian among the trio of freed militants. From Jammu, further south, they plucked the real prize of this exchange from prison: Maulana Mohammed Massoud Azhar, the Pakistani-born preacher who is a secretary-general of the Harkat-ul-Mujahedin, the group to which the hijackers are believed to belong. A third militant: a Briton and former student of the London School of Economics, Syed Abdul Ahmed Sheikh, was collected from New Delhi's Tihar jail. Sheikh had been in prison since October 1994 for his involvement in the kidnapping of three Western tourists. He was never formally charged. All three men were taken to the airport, where they boarded the aircraft with India's Foreign Minister. Singh said the tarmac at Kandahar was too small to accommodate an additional aircraft. He also said he was needed in Afghanistan. 'It was necessary to see the necessary implementation and to have someone in Kandahar who could take decisions on the spot and prevent a last minute hitch,' Singh said. Although Indian officials say the Prime Minister had reconciled himself to a surrender by late Wednesday night, the logistics of a deal were not set in motion until much later. In part, this is due to angry resistance from the Indian security forces, who argued that a surrender would jeopardise their efforts to contain a decade-old separatist uprising in Kashmir. Hardliners in Vajpayee's Cabinet, too, were reluctant to concede the hijackers' demands. Strangely enough so, too, were some of the hostages. After two angry days of protest against New Delhi's delay in opening negotiations, public opinion in India shifted against doing a deal with the hijackers. 'I would have preferred death than seeing India releasing militants in exchange for our lives. Why did the government do it?' said Guru Bhat. For New Delhi, which has made the international fight against terrorism a tenet of its foreign policy, the price of this hijacking drama may simply prove too hard to swallow. 'India's fight against terrorism shall continue unbeaten,' Singh said yesterday. But he did not sound convincing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "science/2000/jan/02/genetics.medicaladvicefortravellers", "type": "article", "sectionId": "science", "sectionName": "Science", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:10Z", "webTitle": "Gene researchers face crisis as man's saviour turns killer", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/jan/02/genetics.medicaladvicefortravellers", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/science/2000/jan/02/genetics.medicaladvicefortravellers", "fields": {"bodyText": "It has been hyped as our saviour, the panacea that will rid mankind of disease. But gene therapy - the use of genetic engineering technology to alter patients' DNA - is giving its practitioners a sudden crisis of confidence. The cause lies with a simple mystery: why did a relatively fit 18-year-old drop dead four days after a genetically altered virus was injected into his liver? The aim was to introduce genes to rectify an enzyme deficiency that Arizona-born Jesse Gelsinger had inherited. The effect was to trigger 'a systemic inflammatory response'. Gelsinger's temperature soared to 104\u00b0F, he slumped into a coma, his lungs filled with fluid, and within four days he had died, on 17 September, in the University of Pennsylvania hospital in Philadelphia. His death has baffled gene therapists already beset by accusations that their technique has failed to live up to the hype surrounding its introduction 10 years ago. Now they face a new problem: perhaps the very basis of their technology poses dangers to patients, a prospect sufficiently worrying to lead to the temporary suspension of many US gene therapy trials after Gelsinger's death. Understanding why he became the first person to die directly as a result of gene therapy has therefore assumed considerable medical importance, as well as being a family tragedy. 'I lost a hero,' Paul Gelsinger said of his son, who fought a long, debilitating battle against the metabolic disease for which he was being treated. Gene therapy for humans began in 1990, when US researchers exploited science's burgeoning knowledge of human genetics to treat Cynthia Cutshall and Ashanthi Desilva, two youngsters who suffered from the same severe immune disorder that plagued John Travolta's character in the 1976 TV movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble. First, cancer specialists led by French Anderson and based in Bethesda, outside Washington, isolated the gene missing from the girls' complement of DNA, inserted it into a virus and used this to infect their cells - the aim being to add the missing gene to their genetic make-up. The experiment was successful, though the effect was not permanent and has to be repeated every few months. Nevertheless, the girls were transformed from sickly, housebound toddlers into exuberant, lively youngsters, and the team's triumph led to a massive hype for gene therapy with Anderson being ranked by Time magazine beside Hippocrates and Pasteur as one of history's most important physicians. However, 10 years later, the case of Cynthia and Ashanthi remains a rare success, one of the field's notable exceptions. Three hundred clinical gene therapy trials on about 3,000 patients - involving dozens of different diseases, from brain tumours to cystic fibrosis to inherited heart conditions - have improved the lives of only a handful of people, and have yet to bring about a full cure of a single patient. Now the therapy has killed one of them. 'There has been a massive amount of hype about gene therapy,' said Oxford geneticist Sir Walter Bodmer. 'And while it may seem a good idea to introduce missing genes into patients to cure their illnesses, there is a real problem of how you do that. Most techniques involve the use of genetically engineered viruses. And that is where the problems begin. The viruses have to be neutralised in some way, and there is no effective way they can be guided so that they insert missing genes into the right place in patients' chromosomes.' Researchers have struggled to improve their accuracy at gene insertion but have yet to report significant breakthroughs. In addition, they have faced the constant problem of ensuring their virus vectors are safe - and it is here that researchers at the University of Pennsylvania's Institute for Human Gene Therapy appear to have come unstuck. A total of 18 patients suffering from the same enzyme deficiency were treated with an adenovirus - a class of virus that causes colds and other conditions. The virus had been altered to carry a gene that would control their ailment but had also been crippled so as not to cause illness on its own. But the team had to give a massive dose to try to get enough of the missing gene into their patients, and Gelsinger received the biggest of all: 38 trillion particles of virus. The group still failed to get the new gene to express itself in any patients and, in Gelsinger's case, appears to have triggered a deadly reaction, though exactly how remains a mystery. At a recent public meeting at the US National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, the leader of the Penn team, Dr James Wilson, spent two days answering scientists' questions about Gelsinger's death to try to find the answer. Many argued that the young man's response was unusual; others suggested such a fatality was waiting to happen. 'You don't need to evoke anything weird,' Art Beaudet, of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, told the journal Science. The publication also quotes a federal official who admitted that the case had done 'damage to gene therapy', and reports that the US Food and Drug Administration has found 'deviations' from trial protocols that may lead to a reprimand for the project leaders. The decision will be a blow to the Pennsylvania team but, far more important, it will underline the stark dilemmas that now beset this 'wonder science'. Either the researchers do not use enough virus and therefore find they cannot get enough life-saving genes into patients' cells or they run the risk of using too much, thus triggering an abnormal, possibly fatal, reaction. 'Gene therapy will have its uses,' said Bodmer. 'It has great potential for attacking cancer, for example. However, as a cure-all, as a panacea, it clearly has limitations. It is far more likely that the knowledge that is now pouring from laboratories round the world about our genes will be exploited to create better and better pharmaceuticals, rather than directly tinkering with our genetic make-up. That is where the real future of medicine lies.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/russia.theobserver", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:10Z", "webTitle": "Tsar Boris's many faces: the  fool, the patriot, the crook", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/russia.theobserver", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/russia.theobserver", "fields": {"bodyText": "The Tsar of all the unpredictables, Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin, stunned the world yet again, this time with news of his sudden exit from power on New Year's Eve. His legacy is very much like a set of Russian matryoshka dolls, though ones pickled in 70\u00b0 proof vodka. Beneath the gutsy fighter for democracy doll, the doll that believed in a new kind of Russia, the hero to the free world who stood on a tank and dared the neo-Stalinists to seize him, was the world-class alcoholic doll. In the annals of East-West d\u00e9tente, diplomats the world over will treasure the memory of Boris's engagement with the nabobs of Ireland. Kremlin One landed on Irish soil, but Boris was so fantastically pissed that his bodyguards would not allow him off the plane. The plane flew off, and all the dipomatic hoo-hah was cancelled. Beneath the drunk doll was a cunning operator of the old Soviet era, who had managed to climb up the greasy pole of the kleptocracy in the dying days of the old Soviet empire under Leonid Brezhnev, and later became the boss of Moscow, no mean achievement. Beneath that doll was a clown, an oaf with his hands on the nuclear trigger, who would happily jiggle his buttocks on stage with a Siberian version of Abba. Beneath the clown doll was a corrupt chancer, his hands so deeply in the till with Russia's treasure that at the end of his reign he stood at the head of a near-gangster state, with crime the country's greatest and most terrifying export. Beneath the gangster doll was a warlord, happy to send young Russian lads - and countless wretched civilians - to their deaths in not one but two bloody adventures in the Caucasus. And the final doll? A son of Mother Russia, a patriot, yes, and one, thank God, whose impetuousness stopped short of hitting the nuclear button in the middle of some wild vodka binge. But Boris Yeltsin will go down in history as the man who launched a New Russia, which had hoped to be democratic and free and not mired in poverty, and then drank himself into a stupor as the whole glorious adventure went rotten from the core. Yeltsin turned out to be too drunk, too sick, too choleric, too greedy and too corrupt to make old Russia embrace the open society. His chosen successor, Vladimir Putin, is a thin-lipped, near-silent ex-spy, an old KGB man with all the hallmarks of an assassin. Not much of a result for democracy, then; still less a legacy for his country. There is no doubting Yeltsin's guts, or that he has always been a proper Russian. In 1930, Ignaty Yeltsin, a well-off peasant of Butka village, in the Urals' main town of Sverdlovsk, was declared a kulak - a land-owning peasant - all but a death sentence under Stalin's rolling terror. His house, mill, farm animals were confiscated by order of the State. His grandfather fled. On 1 February, 1931, a grandson was born to the disgraced family, Boris Nikolayevich. Soon afterwards the family moved to Kazan, in the land of the Tartars. When young Boris was only three, his father, Nikolai Yeltsin, was arrested and convicted of 'anti-Soviet agitation'. He served three years in Stalin's notorious gulag, and Boris's mother made ends meet by working as a seamstress. The young Yeltsin was never a quiet stay-at-home. He blew off two fingers on his left hand while playing with a live grenade. Boris played volleyball and graduated in construction at the Ural Polytechnic in Sverdlovsk. In 1956, three years after Stalin's death, Yeltsin married his college sweetheart, Naina Iosifovna Girina. They have two daughters, Yelena and Tatiana, born in 1957 and 1959 respectively. Yeltsin drank and worked and drank and played tennis and ground his up way through the stultified hierarchy of the old Soviet Union. He joined the Communist Party in 1961, and from then on he was firmly planted on the up escalator of power. A seemingly boring list of job promotions forms the official history. The real one is more Kafkaesque. In 1977 Yeltsin received an order from the Kremlin to destroy the beautiful and historic Ipatyev House, the site of the Bolsheviks' killing of the last Tsar, Nicholas II, and his family in 1918. Yeltsin obeyed. By morning every brick, including the foundations, had been taken to the city dump and the site was paved with the smoothest asphalt. In 1985, Yeltsin was moved to Moscow. He was a construction boss, brilliant at energising workers and getting the factories and houses up. In late 1985, as the torpor and decay of the old Soviet Union seemed ever more obvious, Yeltsin was made city boss of Moscow. But Yeltin's impetuousness got the better of him. In October 1987 he lashed out at his fellow party bosses, condemning the slow pace of reform. The knives were out for him and he fell from power. Heart trouble followed. Two years later he came powering back, elected to the old Soviet parliament as member for Moscow. In 1990 he was elected Speaker, recognised as the most reform-minded politician in the country. He scented the change in the air which the leadership, under Mikhail Gorbachev, feared to act on. In July, Yeltsin left the party that had broken his grandfather. The Soviet Union started to splinter. A year later, Yeltsin was elected President of the Russian Federation. The old, neo-Stalinist guard struck on 20 August, 1991, seizing Gorbachev in the Crimea and seeking Yeltsin's resignation. Instead Yeltsin drove down to the centre of Moscow, stepped on tank number 110, and told the coup plotters to get stuffed - or words to that effect. The coup crumbled, but Gorbachev was finished too. Yeltsin stepped smartly into the power vacuum and created the new Russia. As was his right, he became its first President, but the economy, freed from the grip of dirigisme, all but collapsed. Crime grew rampant and Yeltsin signally failed to get a grip on the State's finances. The wags called the first stage of his economic reforms 'shock without therapy'. Worse was to follow. But the old guard had not had their final say. They seized the White House of Russia. Yeltsin called in the army and the building was shelled with tanks and set on fire. The plotters gave in. The economy was not so easy. On Black Tuesday, 11 October, 1994, the rouble lost over a fifth of its value in one day. Yeltsin started to back off from the liberal reforms he had supported earlier and a horrible mutant emerged, a kind of Leninist-Capitalism, its new, almighty barons the gangsters of a violent kleptocracy. Word started to seep out of the Kremlin that Yeltsin might also be on the take. Under threat at home for his economic failures, the close of 1994 saw the start of a miserable adventure: the first war in Chechnya. Badly led troops, often 19-year-old conscripts, were picked off by the Chechen fighters. In 1995 Yeltsin's heart started to pack in. He had two heart attacks, but the doctors patched him together. The closing years of the Yeltsin rule were ignoble. Prime Ministers were appointed, then fired, with bewildering speed. The core problems - the gangsters, the inertia of the Soviet mind-set, a lack of honesty from top to bottom - lay untackled. International investigators on the trail of Russia's dirty money kept on coming across the names of his family, cronies, and that of Yeltsin himself. In a final throw of the dice, he got himself a new Prime Minister, VladimirPutin. The secret deal behind the public palaver is that Putin gets power now, ahead of the pack of rivals for the presidential elections; Yeltsin gets immunity from prosecution, now. Whether Putin will stick with the deal, or throw Yeltsin to the dogs when it suits him, we shall see. For the moment, one can only note the passing of an old, sick doll that had finally run out of tricks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "news/2000/jan/02/leaders.leaders", "type": "article", "sectionId": "theobserver", "sectionName": "From the Observer", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:12Z", "webTitle": "The great game begins", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jan/02/leaders.leaders", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2000/jan/02/leaders.leaders", "fields": {"bodyText": "The nineteenth century opened with The Observer alerting the country to the risk of a Franco-Spanish fleet landing an army in Ireland as a base to attack the British mainland. The twentieth century began with the paper assessing the risk of Germany declaring war to take advantage of the setbacks of the Boer War. Third time lucky. This time round, our first editorial of the century - and of the millennium - does not have to fear Britain suffering invasion, war and conquest. There are local wars and barbarisms - events in Chechnya and Kosovo this year have been a salutary reminder. Human rights are disregarded too frequently and by too many. But the world's Great Powers are no longer dancing a diplomatic minuet in which war is part of the armoury of statecraft and the acquisition of territory, raw materials, booty and Empire is the intent. In this respect, the first 45 years of the last century represented a continuum with the past; the last 55 years, in which most of today's population were born, represent a remarkable era of prosperity, technological progress and emancipation - and a discontinuity with what has happened before. It is a period during which the position of women has been transformed, the European colonial empires have been dismantled and the dictatorial rule of communism found wanting. Science and technology have transformed our lives, now driving forward with the human genome project and the mobile phone in the way they have done with penicillin and the motor car. Life expectancy has jumped even in the less developed world; illiteracy and innumeracy have fallen; the range of opportunity and lifestyle for ordinary men and women in the advanced democracies is unequalled in richness and diversity. For most people in the West and a growing proportion in the rest of the globe, it is better to be alive in 2000 than in any year before. But the open question is whether this peace and prosperity will last. For example, a fervent Russian nationalist, bent on maintaining the Russian empire, has this weekend succeeded Boris Yeltsin as Russian President and now directs the still formidable Russian military machine, complete with its nuclear arsenal. China retains imperial ambitions. Both could menace global peace. As fundamental, at a time when capitalism is unchallenged as the organising principle of the global economy, is whether we are any nearer to solving the perennial problem about how to marry its dynamic properties with social justice, community and individual well-being. What are the boundaries of the market and market values? How are values like trust, friendship, altruism and respect for the obligations of family to co-exist with the maximisation of profit and the reduction of every relationship to a commodity to be bought and sold? How do societies alleviate the inequality that capitalism brings? And as each individual country wrestles with the issues, how are they to be prevented from exporting their problems to others and so precipitating trade and military rivalry? At a minimum, the tensions can provoke financial collapses and runs on currencies and stock markets; at worst, as we have witnessed over the last century, the consequences are war and mayhem. New barbarism The honest answer is that we are no nearer to solving these problems than our forebears. It is just as plausible to argue that we stand on the verge of a new barbarism, in which the economic and social gains we enjoy disappear in a welter of nationalism, local wars, financial crises and trade protection, as it is to argue that the decades ahead will build and extend the progress we have experienced over the last 55 years. Hence the fevered nature of millennium debate, increasingly polarised between optimists and pessimists. Fifteen years ago, nobody would have predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union and the re-emergence of American economic hegemony; whatever happens in 20 years time we can be sure that it will not have been predicted today. But there are some broad grounds for optimism. In economic terms, inflation has subsided and the new information technologies promise to unleash a surge in productivity, the underlying driver of economic growth. If capitalism is broadly accepted worldwide as the least bad way of organising economic activity - the explicit coda of globalisation - there is a parallel recognition that the circumstances of the poor and disadvantaged have to be underwritten by welfare systems. Health and education have to be provided by the state. In social terms, sexual and racial discrimination are in retreat, although nothing like as rapidly as they should be. There is a growing, if reluctant, recognition that environmental risk must be taken seriously. The advantage of information technology is that it forces transparency and accountability on everyone; the reaction to injustice, bad practice and incompetence in the public and private spheres has to be faster because the dissemination of information is faster. More than that, as economies grow ever more interdependent as a result of the vast new flows of trade and finance, there is a global interest in managing the global economy in a global interest. Even in Russia and China, there is a recognition of the pivotal role of markets, of the role of democracy and the rule of law, of the advantages of being open rather than closed to trade. The optimists can argue that the advantages of globalisation, along with the need to ease society through the sometimes painful social transition, are broadly accepted; the gains from science and technology will become globally disseminated and ever cheaper. The world, in short, is becoming a better place. But there is an equally strong case for pessimism. Everywhere, the new openness is matched by a growth of xenophobia and nationalism, counter the pessimists. Capitalism brings wealth, but it also brings economic and social dislocation, generally created by foreign corporations, foreign workers and foreign products. The natural response of every community is to husband the advantages of the trade and to blame the disadvantages on dastardly foreigners, especially if they are the lodebearers of another culture and its values. This was always true, but it is truer still with the new 'turbo-capitalism', as US economist Edward Luttwak calls its, propelled by mega corporations, embodying dramatic revolutionary changes in technology and more ruthlessly profit-seeking and global in its reach than ever before. The collapse of the communist bloc, the implosion of socialism as an idea, the decline in organised labour and the weakness of public institutions everywhere before the advance of the market has meant the opposing forces to capitalism have never been more feeble. Governments' capacity to ease the transitional costs and growing inequalities are increasingly inadequate. More than that, the contemporary global capitalist system is built on sand. International finance has ruptured national boundaries and has gone global with a capacity to speculate feverishly on a scale never witnessed before. Currencies of the world's largest economies - the US and Japan - can swing violently over months; for small economies, the movements are even more vicious. The warnings that Wall Street is a bubble stock market, with hugely inflated prices and prone to excessive speculation, may have become routine but they are no less serious; the contagion, via the speculation in loss-making Internet companies, is spreading to London. It will only take one overstretched bank or one unexpected economic calamity to knock the whole house of cards sideways and, given the international linkages, for the entire financial system to be sent reeling. International regulation is absent, domestic regulation weak and the capacity of the world's central banks and international monetary authorities to mobilise the scale of countervailing financial support wholly inadequate. An accident is waiting to happen. But, continue the pessimists, that is not all. The protests at the World Trade Organisation's meeting in Seattle, the co-ordinated protests by J18 centred in the City of London, and the assertiveness of the environmentalists are part of a wider movement in which society wants to assert other values and principles besides those of the maximisation of profits. In this sense, religious fundamentalism, whether Christian or Muslim, shares common ground with the green movement, the anti-capitalists and nationalists everywhere. Capitalism alone does not work The cold economic rationality of capitalism, in which every institution is subordinated to the calculus of profit and loss, does not answer the question posed to every human being and every society - that there is more to life than the pursuit of economic efficiency. We are social as well as economic beings. This question can be sidestepped when times are good; prosperity, spending and jobs are a remarkable economic and social lubricant. But if the system starts to falter or malfunction then the wider issues open up immediately. And the great Achilles' Heel of contemporary capitalism, even amid so much plenty, is that it is disfigured and pockmarked by inequality. The gap between the incomes of the rich and poor in the advanced democracies is widening and the disparity of wealth is extraordinary. As information technology drills deep into the make-up of our economy and society, so the capacity and access to the new technology is creating another layer of inequality. And if inequality between the top and bottom is widening, it is also widening within every sub-group of society; it is not only winners at the top who are paid disproportionately well, but at every level. Nor is that all. The disparity of income and wealth between countries is also becoming insupportable. More than a billion people live in abject poverty, their collective income no more than 600 of the richest men and women on Earth. This is the great truth about globalisation and the global business civilisation that is being built in its wake, but it remains the truth that dare not speak its name. The new intellectual fashion is not to worry about the so-called gap between rich and poor; the incomes of those at the top or who have done well are no longer of legitimate concern it is argued by the economic and political establishment; what matters is that there is a minimum safety net for those at the bottom, a tight labour market and the chance for everyone to acquire a vital minimum of educational and training skills. No wider effort at taming capitalism or reducing the scale of inequality can be attempted. The only realistic policy option is to do what can be done - run conservative economic policies and try to sustain an infrastructure of support for the poorest while turning a blind eye to the excesses of the rich. They and the markets and corporations they run will move elsewhere if regulation, taxation or public initiative are attempted. Less developed countries are seized by the same philosophy. If they want to grow, then they must accept the terms dictated by the West. They must deregulate, privatise, liberalise, roll back the public sector and give up on attempts to equalise income and wealth. Once they accept this agenda, then they can expect the great Western corporations to locate production there and bring with them technology, skills and employment. For the developed world, this means that, with even China now trying to join the WTO, there is the prospect of a genuine world labour market, in which their own working class is competing for jobs, with unskilled labour in the Third World prepared to work for as little as a dollar a day. If we think inequality now is becoming unacceptable, then what promises to unfold in the years ahead will take us into new realms. Yet the insouciance bordering on nonchalance with which this prospect is greeted by both the private- and public-sector proponents of globalisation promises to be a calamitous misjudgment, and in this respect the pessimists are right. We only need to look back to the beginning of the century to realise how in very similar circumstances - an emerging global market, an era of immense technological innovation and the creation of a world financial system - that the resulting inequalities had consequences that proved ungovernable and were the underlying driver of war and depression. It was the profound anger at economic and social inequality that underpinned the growth of socialism and communism in the first 40 years of the century, and it was the need to provide a counterbalancing force that fostered the fascist response. American isolation, then as now, meant that formal international co-operation in the League of Nations was a dead letter from the start. When the US stock market crashed, there were no financial firebreaks to stop the flames from spreading to the rest of the US and then the world's financial system. A real chance In short, the clash between inequality and the prevailing consensus that laissez-faire and free markets must remain untouched proved a disaster. Capitalism must be governed if its worst excesses are to be avoided, but when it slips its national moorings and goes global, as it did before 1914 and is doing now, then if the governing structures do not follow, society is exposed to the mercies of volatile markets and the quest for economic efficiencies. Society, one way or another, hits back. So as the century and millennium opens, the challenge could hardly be clearer, but economic and political leadership never more wanting. The United States has emerged as the world's unchallenged power, but it has become ever more brazen in its attempt to run the globe only according to its own interests, whether over defence or the role of the dollar. The European Union, which could be an effective compensating force, lacks confidence, cohesion or direction. The capacity to establish and assert a global interest, the over-riding need of our times, is thus gravely enfeebled. Yet the technologies and wealth that the optimists point to as the harbingers of better times do offer great possibilities. We can reinvent our cities and our societies. We can live better than ever and longer than ever. There are widening and wonderful choices open to us about how we live our lives. But to win those great prizes, we must do more than abdicate responsibility to markets and private corporations, as the new consensus is close to advocating. Instead, we must insist that the wealth they create be put to civic and social purpose, and that requires that we limit inequality, assert the case for justice and make our voice heard nationally and internationally through the only means open to us - democratic governance. Every tool at hand must be exploited, notably the EU. There is no choice in the matter. If we shrink from our responsibility, then this century could hold terrors more serious than the last. If we meet them, then we have a real chance to build an enduring and just civilisation.

It's the same old story. Without my contacts, I can't read any of the letters on the eye chart. I can't see that there are actual letters on the eye chart. To tell you the truth, I can't even see that there is an eye chart. For years, we've been discussing laser surgery, and for years Dr C has been saying that it's too experimental, that he doesn't trust the technology. But he's changed his mind. There's a new procedure, with better lasers, and and he's so enthusiastic about it that he's doing five or six operations a week, without any complications (yet). He does some tests which involve sticking various things into my eyes and shining lights into their inner recesses and says that if I want it, I'm ready. September 1999 Do I really want this operation? I've needed glasses since I was seven and, according to family legend, dramatically failed to see the beautiful wild goat silhouetted against the sunset in the distance while on holiday in Greece. 'I can't see him!' I cried (apparently). I've heard about the goat so much that I think of him as a Dr Seuss character: 'I could not see him from the boat/ I could not see that big, huge goat.' It was the start of a long period of bad eyesight and bad eyeglasses: bulbous tortoiseshell ones in the Seventies; bulbous silver ones during the Eighties, and horrible little round ones in later years. I got contact lenses when I was 12 and spent the next 20 years putting them in and taking them out, cleaning them, soaking them and watching them drift away into the netherworld that is the bathroom floor, never to be seen again. I lost the first one in a hurricane on Long Island in 1978. I lost the last one in my house in London in 1999. But I'm used to being nearly blind. (This is how nearly blind I am: my eyesight is roughly 20-2,000, meaning that what a perfectly sighted person can see from 2,000 feet - ie, blobs of grey - I can see from 20 feet.) I'm used to the morning ritual of running my hand across the bedside table to 'look' for my glasses. I'm used to the non-lens-magnified world, a wash of muted colours and bleeding lights. I enjoy long, maudlin reveries about how if I lived in the Dark Ages, I would be one of the blind people in the village, begging for scraps of food by the side of the road as citizens kicked me and laughed at the rags hanging pathetically from my gaunt body. I've always blamed a number of my most glaring problems on poor eyesight, including a fear of heights; an inability to remember what people look like, even ones I met five minutes earlier; and a tendency to drive erratically, sometimes like a little old lady, and sometimes as if there is a fire on the road behind me. What will happen, I wonder, when I lose the ability to not see? 25 October The doctor has ordered me not to wear contacts or eye make-up for 10 days before the surgery, at a key time when I have to go to a lot of parties, including the Booker Prize. This period of hell, in which I am forced to wear my highly unflattering glasses publicly (latest pair: tiny, little wire frames, like those of a mole) without benefit of cosmetic enhancement, reminds me why I want the surgery so badly. 26 October I present myself at Dr C's office, pleased with the drugs I have been prescribed: Valium for nerves and Percocet for pain. I took Percocet recreationally in the Eighties! This should be fun. I throw back a Valium, under orders, so that I will be 'compliant' during the surgery. I take my place in the waiting-room of the laser lab, with a number of other patients, all of them men in their thirties who have brought their wives. I have brought my mother. I sit down in the laser room, surrounded by nurses whose job is to grip my hands in order to prevent me from leaping, screaming, from the chair. I am not going to give full details of the surgery - the clamping of the lid, the minute cut to the eye with some sort of implement, the lasering of the inside - because they are not for the squeamish (if you want a grislier description, you can e-mail me, lyall@nytimes.com, but I have to warn you that I do not understand exactly what happened). 'It's such a pleasure to operate on blue eyes!' Dr C says, by way of making me stop whimpering. It only takes a couple of minutes per eye and, weirdly, there's no pain at all. But it's very, very strange and uncomfortable. I have been instructed to stare directly at a blinking red light. 'Whatever you do, DON'T LOOK AWAY,' the doctor repeatedly warns - and all I want to do is look away, just to see what would happen. But I don't. I can't even smell burning eyeball, which some people have warned me about. Afterwards, my eyes feel dry and scratchy and I don't want to open them ever again. But when I do, it's clear that my vision has already dramatically improved. I go home and take a long sleep, fortified by my nice tablets. 27 October As instructed, I'm putting in eyedrops every hour, three different kinds, and my eyes are so dry that the obvious result of the surgery - that I can see just about perfectly - doesn't fill me with the kind of joy you might expect. But I manage to read the paper, take the subway to my newspaper's office in Times Square, recognise most of my colleagues and have lunch with the entire New York Times foreign desk without spilling any food. I drop in at Dr C's. He does some tests and then afterwards says something that I never expected to hear in this lifetime: 'Your vision is 20-20.' I pay him. The operation is costing me a month's salary, but with these results, it certainly seems worth it. Week 1 My eyesight seems to be getting worse. I think of Flowers for Algernon , a story I read a long time ago that was (and I may be getting this wrong) about a happy, retarded person who takes drugs that make him smart, and who gradually becomes retarded again as the drugs stop working. And he's never happy again, because somewhere in the depths of his simple mind he remembers what it was like to be smart. What if I'm going blind, after my brief flirtation with perfect eyesight? The truth is that I can function well enough in the world, but I feel tired and spaced out and off-balance. All I want to do, really, is stay in bed and read, but my eyes are so dry and irritated that I can't read for long. I panic, of course. I am stupid and vain and impetuous and I have made a dreadful mistake. You should never trust technology, because as much as you try to control it, it will always end up controlling you. The flight back to London is terrible. Whatever it is - the air pressure, the dryness of the cabin, my general hysteria - conspires to make my eyes feel like someone is blowing sand into them through a straw. I have to put drops in every five minutes. It's like being 18 and stoned and addicted to Visine. Week 2 This week isn't so great, either. My eyes don't hurt, but the vision in my left eye seems markedly worse than that in my right eye, and I seem to need the eyedrops more than ever. What's this all about? I phone Dr C in panic, but he tells me not to worry. I send a distressed e-mail to my colleague Maureen in Washington, who had the surgery some months ago and is as happy as an eagle now. 'You don't remember the blurriness,' she says. Weeks 3-5 Maureen is right. As each day improves a little bit, I'm starting to forget how uneasy I felt before. And I'm starting to take seeing for granted, the way other people do. I'm not sure what the epiphanal moment is. Maybe it's when I wake up with a start in a hotel room, start to grope for my glasses and then realise that I can read the time on the clock, flashing red across the room. Maybe it's when I'm dozing off in bed with my seven-month-old baby and find that I don't have to get up and take out my contacts, because I'm not wearing any. Or maybe it's when I finally chuck the whole expensive lot - lenses, cases, cleaning supplies, vials for soaking and storing and enzymatically scrubbing - into the garbage bin, like someone discarding an unwanted old skin. Of course, it isn't as if I can suddenly see after never been able to see before. People whose short-sightedness is correctable, as mine was, are hardly in the same category as people who are blind. But I can't believe how much this has meant to me. I never trusted my eyes before. I always felt I had the ability to see only on sufferance, as an ephemeral privilege that had been granted to me but that could vanish in a moment. And, of course, there was all that worrying that my contact lenses would tear or shred or melt or fly out of my eyes, that my glasses would break, that I would be in a storm, lose my contacts, fall on my glasses, and then die of exposure when I couldn't find my way out of the woods. There is none of that now. There is just me and a pair of eyes which are facing the world without any help, and which feel better and brighter and more acute than they ever have before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "theobserver/2000/jan/02/featuresreview.review1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "theobserver", "sectionName": "From the Observer", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:15Z", "webTitle": "A tale of two cities", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2000/jan/02/featuresreview.review1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/theobserver/2000/jan/02/featuresreview.review1", "fields": {"bodyText": "One of the main attractions at the 1900 Universal Exhibition in Paris was the Cineorama where visitors climbed aboard a simulation of a vast hot-air balloon to watch 10 projectors create a flickering, 360-degree illusion of the city disappearing beneath them. As they appeared to rise to the clouds, they could look down on the sharp grid of criss-crossing boulevards and the neat rows of elegant apartment blocks that had made their city the envy of the world. Over on the outer rim of this celluloid domain, things might not have looked quite so tidy, but that was just a blur and hardly mattered. The entranced balloonists were floating above the most beautiful city on earth, though in some ways that, too, was only an illusion. In the philosopher Walter Benjamin's classic tribute, Paris was 'the capital of the nineteenth century', and the Royal Academy, in its forthcoming 1900 exhibition, will celebrate the art of that century. The exhibition will recreate some of the Exposition Universelle of that year, and includes a section devoted to 'the city'. Other European and North American cities may have shared Paris's sprawling growth from the 1850s on, but the French alone seemed to have confronted the challenge with vigour and style. The Paris we know and love was the idea of Napoleon III and his city planner, Baron Haussmann. While we can accept that they were genuine in wanting to create the most beautiful city in Europe, and that part of this involved sweeping away the insanitary hovels that disfigured large sections of central Paris, it was equally the case that those who benefited most were Napoleon's supporters in the financial community. They were granted cleared land on which to build the sumptuous apartment blocks and elegant hotels that now line the Rue de Rivoli and the areas around the newly laid-out Parc Monceau, places still accessible only to the richest sections of society. The original inhabitants were driven away, out to the very edges of the town, to areas whose names were to become redolent of squalor and abandon: Clichy, Batignolles, Montmartre, La Villette, Belleville. It is difficult for us to imagine now the wretchedness of life in the Montmartre maquis or in London's Whitechapel or any of the dozens of pitiful slums and shanty towns that marred the urban areas of the industrialised nations. Only a glimpse of the fringes of a Third World city today offers some idea of how bad they were. Yet that said, from these fetid slums would emerge the new working-class heroes, the singers and dancers who were to be the stars of the brightly lit boulevards. In any case, so successful had Haussmann been in concentrating the shanty towns and crumbling tenements at the city's outer rim that most visitors to Paris had no idea of what lay beyond the sparkling new department stores and fashionable restaurants. The city went to considerable lengths to promote its role as the centre of all that was new and exciting, holding a series of universal exhibitions to showcase the best in art and commerce. Held at regular intervals throughout the nineteenth century, these were self-contained cities within the greater metropolis, each an experimental environment where the new could be unveiled in an atmosphere that was part scientific demonstration, part funfair. It must be said that it was the latter that most attracted tens of thousands to these mammoth events, the majority of whom were in search of distraction rather than knowledge. The enormous exhibition of 1900 attempted to unveil the technological wonders that awaited the new century: the first underground railway was built to coincide with the show and an electric train took visitors on a tour of the grounds in a mere 20 minutes, while an amazing two-mile moving pavement carried astonished travellers past the international pavilions that bordered the Seine. But to most visitors, the biggest attractions were not the formal displays of new industrial products but thrilling spectacles like the Cineorama, prefiguring the first Zeppelin flight later that year. Clearly, most people viewed technological advance as just another form of entertainment, and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the most important element in big city life was less the new drains and street-lights and more the rise of the new showbusiness, a world of professional performers, some of whom became the first 'stars', worshipped by an adoring public - for a time at least. Much of the credit for this must go to an extraordinary Spaniard, Joseph Oller, who has some claim to be the father of modern showbusiness. He owned a swimming pool, an aquarium and the Nouveau Cirque on the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9 that featured the first tip-up chairs, an Oller invention which soon spread to virtually every modern theatre on the planet. Oller quickly realised that when the Parisians abandoned their city in the hot summer months, his audience was largely made up of foreign visitors eager to sample the sort of amusements unknown to less fun-loving capital cities. Thus the canny showman began to frequent the working-class dance halls where he saw how supposedly respectable bourgeois folk were attracted to an atmosphere of risk and sensuality, provided things did not get out of hand. What they wanted was the sight of La Goulue kicking her feet so high it might just be possible to imagine you had seen something utterly forbidden. What they did not like were fights and pickpockets. Having reached this conclusion, Oller decided to give them what he guessed they wanted. When the Moulin Rouge opened its doors on Sunday 6 October 1889, so much anticipation had built up that the place was crammed with people of all kinds, from the fashionable to the merely curious, with a sufficient sprinkling of the rough to convince the rest that the place was nicely naughty. The greatest draw was certainly the place itself - a cavernous dance hall lit by newly-fangled electric lights that added sparkle to the crowded scene, which was whipped into a frenzy when the line of shrieking dancers dashed on to the floor and began their synchronised, high-kicking can-can. From the start, the Moulin Rouge was a succ\u00e8s de scandale , for there was, of course, another equally blatant side to the club's activities - it was quite simply the biggest open market for sex in the capital, though this was only the latest manifestation of what was probably the most extraordinary by-product of the new city - the plentiful provision of all manner of sexual distractions for the male population. This was a growth industry that was itself an offshoot of the startling changes that urban existence had brought to the lives of many men during the fin de si\u00e8cle. We can see something of this in the art of Degas who was obsessed by that curious mirror-image to all those sparkling new restaurants and dance halls, the dimly-lit world of the brothel. In the main, Degas avoided the most clich\u00e9d aspects of bought love, which was often glossed as a merry romp in the glittering crystal-lit salons of the capital, though he stops short of exposing the maisons de tol\u00e9rance, the licensed brothels, as the places of exploitation they clearly were. In some of his prints he appears to be taking much the same line as Guy de Maupassant did in his short stories, where the local brothel is a sort of jolly cat house, with saucy women who are inclined to jump into bed with each other or to cuddle up to the madame on her name-day. Like Maupassant, Degas shows the humble, side-street maison-close, the cheap, plain establishment frequented by increasing numbers of unattached males, a result of the shift in population from village and town to city that so fractured nineteenth-century existence. Similar concerns can be detected in some of Degas's paintings of young women at work in the city and the studies of ballet dancers that are among his best-known pictures. To those who have derived much innocent pleasure from these apparently innocuous works, the idea that there is a link with the brothel will seem preposterous, until you accept that they contain coded messages about a role forced on many women at the time. Rapid urbanisation and the consequent weakening of family and marriage ties, from the middle of the century on, had radically altered women's lives, throwing many into low-paid employment as shop assistants, waitresses, seamstresses, laundresses, hairdressers, servants and milliners. Insecure and unprotected, many saw no alternative to accepting the advances of any man willing to offer a 'present' for their services. At two to four francs a day, a Parisian milliner could not have survived without some form of additional income, and a contemporary study of registered prostitutes reveals that 75 per cent of the filles inscrites had migrated from the provinces to Paris where they initially worked in drink shops, laundries and sewing studios until financial reality forced them to become sex-workers. All this would have been well enough known to anyone looking at a Degas painting of a millinery shop at the time. Likewise, the young girls training to be ballet dancers, whom Degas shows practising at the barre or slumped in repose. These unsmiling figures are slaving to liberate themselves from the marginal world of their mothers, those seamstresses and laundresses, sometimes glimpsed in the background, dressed in prim black bonnet and clutching a formidable handbag in an attempt to generate an air of bourgeois respectability. In reality, the ballet was a brothel by other means, and the men who hung around the opera house were as often found backstage in the rehearsal studios or corridors, rather than front of house engrossed by the performance. There was another side to this dismal picture. A few women found that the breakdown of the restrictive moral and legal code that had dominated the century offered them the chance to free themselves from the constraints of marriage and child-rearing. It is this that the art of Toulouse-Lautrec often reveals in his studies of the new stars like the dancers Jane Avril and La Goulue and the singer Yvette Guilbert, who chose to have lesbian relationships rather than tie themselves to a man who would almost certainly have tried to control their careers. Inevitably perhaps, many men felt threatened by these 'new-women'; hence all the sinful Eves and seductive Salom\u00e9s - woman as temptress, woman as destroyer - that turn up so often in fin-de-si\u00e8cle art. Many paid a heavy price for trying to go it alone. La Goulue ended up a hopeless drunk, eking out her last years in the filthy shanty town on the northern slope of Montmartre, so different from the glittering world on the opposite side, where she had been the greatest of all the new stars. But that was another of the contradictions inherent in the new urban jungle - La Goulue began as a poor laundress, rocketed to showbusiness heaven, then plunged back to finish among rag pickers and petty thieves on the very edge of city life. The new city might give but it also snatched back its gifts with a brutal indifference.

Salmonella enteritidis, once only found in rats and mice, has reached epidemic proportions among humans. Scientists believe the bug has spread by rodents infecting factory-farmed chickens. It then reaches humans through chicken meat and eggs. Detecting enteritidis in broiler chickens is difficult, in eggs impossible. Although it makes itself miserably apparent in humans once diagnosed, it is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics. Intensive farming methods have enabled the infection to flourish. A vaccination programme which began in the UK in 1994 seems to have had little effect in controlling the epidemic. In 1981, enteritidis made 1,482 people in the UK violently ill. By the late Nineties, that figure had risen to nearly 40,000. In 1988 alone, the number of cases doubled - the same year Edwina Currie was sacked as a Health Minister for saying that most UK egg production was contaminated with salmonella. Until now health officials have been mystified by the sudden explosion in numbers. But this week a group of scientists will publish research showing the phenomenon is directly related to the eradication of other diseases in chickens. Culling sick birds and using antibiotics so harmed the immunity of Britain's chickens that the door was opened for the virulent enteritidis to gain a stranglehold. The cramming together of large flocks of birds under intensive farming methods allowed it to spread. The five-year research programme at the Texas University Health Science Centre looked at the prevalence of various salmonella bugs in humans and poultry in the United States, England and Wales. Professor Billy Hargis said the researchers' findings had 'astonished and scared' the team. 'We looked at data from Britain, Germany, the US and Canada and the picture was the same. 'Salmonella enteritidis has been steadily increasing and the leaps in the Eighties correspond to our control of salmonella pullorum and chicken typhoid. 'The density of animals kept together in modern farming of course exacerbates the whole picture. We were shocked by the notion that in eradicating two diseases we had in effect allowed a far stronger and more dangerous salmonella to emerge. 'The scary fact seems to be that by man intentionally eradicating a disease, he simply opens up an ecological niche for another unheard-of illness. The consequences are frightening.' Salmonella causes approximately three-quarters of all food poisoning cases. The salmonella pathogen results in diarrhoea, vomiting and fever which can last for four to seven days. It can lead to hospitalisation and death. The elderly and young children are particularly at risk and doctors are becoming increasingly worried about the estimated 34 per cent of infections that they are finding to be resistant to antibiotics. Oddly, salmonella victims also have an increased risk of suffering from arthritis in later life. Hargis and his team believe the answer lies in the fast development of a vaccine for use in the chicken sheds. One vaccine already exists, but with a poor success rate, said Hargis. But Dr Henry Smith of Britain's Laboratory of Public Health said he believed the vaccine, together with improved hygiene on farms, would tackle the scourge of salmonella enteritidis. A vaccination programme began in the UK in 1994. The incidence of reported cases in humans fell slightly the following year, but rose again by 1996. Farmers are less confident. Tim Bennett, deputy president of the National Farmers' Union, said: 'As fast as we deal with one food safety problem, another crops up.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/02/sarahryle.theobserver", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:16Z", "webTitle": "Samaritans split over obscene calls", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/02/sarahryle.theobserver", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/02/sarahryle.theobserver", "fields": {"bodyText": "The founder of the Samaritans has called on the organisation to set up a unit to deal with obscene callers. The Reverend Prebendary Edward 'Chad' Varah - one of three Companions of Honour in the New Year's Honours List - said it was one of the great disappointments to him that the support network he began in a City of London church almost 50 years ago has abandoned one of its founding principles: to befriend all who called. Volunteers are trained to terminate 'masturbation calls' on the grounds that they are an abuse of the service and 'not appropriate or beneficial to the caller'. But Varah, 88, wants to reinstate a special division, known as the Brendas, which he established in 1958 in response to a question left by volunteers in the log books: 'What to do with obscene calls?' 'I wrote: \"Befriend them, of course\",' said Varah, who divided his volunteers into those prepared to listen to 'pornographic' callers, on the basis that they were not personally the target of the fantasies, and those who were not. That division was abandoned in 1987. Varah now wants it restored - at least in one branch in each of the 14 Samaritan regions across the country. Simon Armson, chief executive of the Samaritans, said: 'We are unable to help some people who may want to maintain contact with us inappropriately when they should be moving on and finding a sustainable relationship in their own life. 'But we are trying to keep in touch with society and we will never shut the door on anything.' The ruling body turned down Varah's proposals to reintroduce the Brenda line three years ago. But Varah's fresh plea will reopen the debate at the time when his visionary contribution is being officially recognised. Varah has attracted controversy for most of his working life. He was already a well-known champion of sex education for young people when he took the first Samaritan call in 1953. 'My first job as a young parson was to take the funeral of a 13-year-old girl who committed suicide when her period started,' he explained. 'I vowed as a I stood over her grave that I would teach children about sex and I began that night with my youth club.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/02/tonythompson.theobserver", "type": "article", "sectionId": "artanddesign", "sectionName": "Art and design", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:17Z", "webTitle": "Museum's \u00a33m Cezanne stolen", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/02/tonythompson.theobserver", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/02/tonythompson.theobserver", "fields": {"bodyText": "While Britain partied into the new millennium, a \u00a33 million painting by C\u00e9zanne was stolen from one of Britain's finest museums. The theft came four days after the former head of Scotland Yard's art and antiques squad predicted a surge in art crime this year because police have cut back on their specialist squads. The work - Auvers-sur-Oise (The Fence) - depicts a cluster of small white cottages set in a tree-filled valley and dates from around 1880. It was taken from the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford at 1.30am yesterday and represents the first big heist of 2000. Police said the thieves appeared to have broken in through the main gallery's glass roof as thousands of revellers were celebrating on the city's streets. The thieves seem to have gained access from the adjoining Oxford University Library, which is undergoing building work, before clambering over rooftops to reach the museum itself. Forensic officers were yesterday searching the area for clues. At a conference at the museum yesterday, Superintendent John Carr of Oxford Police, who is leading the hunt for the thieves, said he believed the painting had been stolen to order. 'Whoever has taken this painting has given it some thought in relation to the manner the painting has been stolen. The person has some reason for it and some outlet for it.' Christopher Brown, director of the Ashmolean, described the theft as a 'shattering blow'. The Ashmolean is home to one of Britain's finest art collections, which includes works by Leonardo da Vinci, Picasso, Van Gogh and Michelangelo. It also features a lantern that belonged to a justice of the peace present at the arrest of Guy Fawkes. It is not the first time the Ashmolean, the world's oldest public museum, has been targeted by thieves. In 1997 a gang tried to steal a 1,100-year-old jewel made for Alfred the Great, gaining entry via scaffolding put up during a \u00a33m refurbishment. The three-strong gang attacked the glass encasing the centrepiece without success and set off the alarm system. The previous year, two seventeenth-century bottles made in France were stolen from the museum. In 1992 security measures were stepped up after Greek vases, paintings, silverware and a sixteenth-century painting were stolen by a visitor under his coat and a collection of jewellery worth \u00a350,000 was taken. However, former Detective Inspector Charles Hill - the man behind the 1994 recovery of Munch's The Scream - last week dismissed the idea that art theft was still a gentleman's crime. In fact, increasingly often it is carried out by gangs with links to drugs and arms dealing. The Sicilian Mafia have for years used the art market to launder millions of pounds of drug money. Items are smuggled out of the country and sold on the black market. Museums are often reluctant to publicise thefts for fear of attracting more problems. As a result most other major European countries have built up their own national art crimes squad. Scotland Yard employs only two detective constables. Great art thefts At the Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990, robbers dressed as police took seven paintings worth a total of \u00a3130m, including Vermeer's The Concert and Rembrandt's Storm on the Sea of Galilee. It was the biggest art raid of all time. In May 1998 thieves crept barefoot through Rome's National Museum of Modern Art and took two Van Goghs and a Cezanne. In 1994, two robbers escaped with two Turners valued at more than \u00a320 million from Frankfurt's Schirn Gallery. The paintings were on loan from the Tate. In Britain, in January 1995, a man stole a Picasso worth \u00a3650,000 in 35 seconds from the Lefevre Gallery in London's West End and made his getaway in a waiting taxi. In May 1996 a painting attributed to Constable and valued at several million pounds was stolen from the office of the Assistant Commissioner of City of London police. In 1994, Edvard Munch's most famous painting, The Scream, was stolen from the National Gallery in Oslo. It was eventually recovered by Scotland Yard. In May 1999, a haul stolen four months earlier from the York City gallery, including a Turner watercolour worth \u00a3500,000, was found in the boot of a car 60 miles away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "politics/2000/jan/02/thatcher.uk", "type": "article", "sectionId": "politics", "sectionName": "Politics", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:19Z", "webTitle": "Tory rift widens as Heath and Norris attack lurch to the right", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/02/thatcher.uk", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/02/thatcher.uk", "fields": {"bodyText": "Two Tory heavyweights have joined the attack on the Conservative Party's drift to the right, reopening divisions laid bare by last week's dramatic outburst by former premier John Major. Steven Norris, the probable Tory contender in this year's London mayoral election, forecast that 80 per cent of the electorate would turn their backs on the party if it reverted to Eighties-style Thatcherism. And another former Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath, told The Observer yesterday that the current leadership under William Hague was talking 'nonsense' when it denied that such a rightward lurch was happening. Yesterday Hague flew to Montana with his wife, Ffion, for a much-needed break after another week of chaos and recrimination in his unhappy party. Aides say he will spend a week 'in the back of beyond' practising a physically demanding form of cross-country skiing. According to the weather reports, he will have to wade through snow 48 inches deep, which is likely to be easier going than managing the Tory Party. Norris pointedly urged him to follow the advice he received last week from his predecessor. He said: 'I find myself in sympathy with John Major, because what he is saying to those people who want to regress the Tories to the right is that their way is not likely to succeed at the next election. 'What he said was perfectly helpful. It may be an attack on sections of the Right, and I say amen to that, but it was not an attack on William Hague's leadership. 'The Tories will win when they attract not only the 20 per cent core support but another 20 per cent as well, and this means becoming a more tolerant and inclusive party.' Attacks on the revived Tory Right came from so many directions last week that Heath declined interviews in case it appeared that he was part of a plot. He is known to share Major's anger at the way both former Prime Ministers were airbrushed out of party history during its autumn conference, when Margaret Thatcher was given great prominence and allowed to promote her campaign to free the former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet. Speaking from his Salisbury home, and sounding cheerful, Heath said: 'Those boys have been going into it with such enthusiasm that it would look like an organised crime if I joined in.' But he added: 'For some people to go on saying there has been no movement of the party to the right is absolute nonsense.' Publicly, Hague responded to Major's attack by denying that he had taken the party to the right. In private his aides suggested the former Prime Minister was motivated by pique. One said: 'John Major resents the way his premiership has been criticised. He resents the way he is held responsible for what went wrong. The bad blood between him and Thatcher is obviously quite acute.' Tory MP Julian Lewis, who resigned from his post at Tory Central Office in 1996 in protest at Major's 'weak' leadership, said sarcastically: 'If the party under the leadership of John Major with Ken Clarke holding a gun to his head had led us to stunning victory, I might think their advice worth taking.' The Observer has learnt that Major wrote his broadside a fortnight ago, at about the time Witney MP Shaun Woodward announced his defection to Labour. David Curry, who resigned from the Shadow Cabinet two years ago in protest at Hague's hard line on Europe, said: 'John told me before Christmas that he had written this piece, so I have been waiting for this Exocet to go off.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/religion.uk", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:19Z", "webTitle": "Beyond belief", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/religion.uk", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/religion.uk", "fields": {"bodyText": "I met a man just before the eve of 2000, a busy and successful actor who had suffered a lot in the last decade. He told me he would spend the millennial evening alone, looking at the stars, thinking, dreaming. He wanted to garner some meaning, as one century ratcheted into another; he wanted to let his mind settle, expand. We used to call this prayer. When religion fades, many rituals fade with it, leaving behind a few husks which we fill with our own meanings. Until very recently, the year was measured out in rituals, hundreds of them to take you step by tiny, certain step from New Year's Day to Christmas Eve. Look at your diary and you may still see the names of religious festivals which for many of us are incomprehensible. What are Palm Sunday and Ember Day, not to mention Septuagesima Sunday and the Golden Number and Rogation Sunday? There were particular prayers for particular events - prayers for rainy days, prayers to ward off the plague, prayers for the sick and the suffering and the negligent and the faithful. The rosary. The bell, book and candle. These were ways of marking out each stage of life, from birth to old age: christening, confirmation, coming of age, marriage. People still marry in church, even when they have no belief, but how many non-believers christen their child now - stand up and speak the centuries-old words that have lost their meaning? Of course, I write of Christianity, having been bought up in a vaguely Christian way (church on Christmas Day and Easter, a few prayers off by heart, a dim knowledge of the Bible, especially the Gospels and the Psalms). Each religion has its own rituals, its calendar and its schedule: candles in the window, stones on the grave, prayers facing east, the fasts and the feasts. Formal incantations, spoken together, making up a community: a chant, a spectacle, a piece of magic which everyone believed in that gave shape to shapeless time and order to the random, often brutal age. Having a life ruled and ordered by rituals is like stepping on the cracks. Pace by pace, you may live your life according to your culture. Now we plummet through the year. Christmas, Easter, school terms and school holidays: giant leaps across sickening furls of racing time. Like many people, I adore and need rituals and yet have no religion, possess few given rites of passage to help me from month to month. I make them up, fanatically dividing time into manageable segments, each solemnised by rituals. Birthdays, anniversaries, the beginning of terms, the beginning of holidays, Sunday suppers: each become something freighted with my desire to make them mean more than they do. I think a lot of us do this, seeking private ways of filling the spaces left behind by faith. How do we think of ourselves now? As individuals, who chose our own lives; as self-inventors; as radically uncertain and subjective; as people who can begin again, any time we want to, as modern and rational beings in an increasingly Godless world; above all, as free, unchained from the patterns of the tyrannical past, unwilling and unable to give up our individuality to any higher power. We are modern, and modernism necessarily endangers rituals, which are about tradition and a kind of conservatism, and about the possibility of losing ourselves, surrendering ourselves to the ritual. (Graham Greene said that even when a corrupt, non-believing Catholic priest held communion, it did not lose its meaning; the individual is irrelevant within the transcendent ceremony.) When belief withers, material objects tend to flood in to the emptied-out symbols that used to house faith. Rituals are created by repetition, but they need belief if they are to keep their resonance - and belief does not necessarily need to imply religion. Many rituals are secular: the wigs and gowns of the court; the ceremonies of Parliament; the military rituals which keep an individual firmly lashed to the rules of the Army. Without our belief, they gradually turn into something else - a spectacle, a charade, a piece of theatre, a custom. They may remain outwardly the same, but their meaning changes; what was once an assertion of faith becomes an expression of nostalgia and longing, or of conformity. They may still be powerful, but they no longer have the same function, which is to connect the individual with community; the present moment with the past; the living with the dead; the faithful with the officiating; the earthly with the transcendent. In many instances, the public and coherent meaning of rituals have become a set of fragmented, private traditions. It is too easy to say that Christmas has lost its meaning and moan about consumerism and the facile materialism of modern life. It's rather that the collective has dissolved into separate, individual ones. Those family customs acquire potent significance over the years - what goes on top of the tree, what time you open your presents, whether you play Monopoly or charades; the whole hidden history of a family that gets played out each year. It's similar to when people marry in church, even if they no longer believe in God. It is not just because they want to dress in white and be a bride and never mind the religious bits; for this one moment, they want to experience the solemnity that a church and a church wed ding offers. Churches, as Philip Larkin said, are places to be serious in, places where you go with your freight of pain and your misdeeds and are absolved. And in a church, even when God is absent, you are surrounded by all the dead, with their ancient thoughts and their urgent prayers. Old and new merge. I am an atheist who married in a register office, but I can sympathise with those who don't want the clerkish atmosphere of the civic ceremony, the threadbare, legalistic words. The most unbelieving heart throbs to the words of the church wedding, or to the words of the Book of Common Prayer. I have the book beside me now, beautifully reissued by Everyman. Reading it, I understand that until our modern age it wasn't really a book at all, not in the sense we understand it. It was a ceremony, liturgical and ritualistic. In the introduction, it is described as a 'piece of theatre, designed to be performed by an entire people, week by week, day by day _ a drama of human life and destiny where all those present have a speaking part' - 'Lift up your hearts'; 'We lift them up unto the Lord.' The rites inscribed in its pages mark the stages of human life, from birth to death. Baptism, confirmation, marriage, childbirth, sickness, sorrow and death. It is a treasure-house of English literature and a book of myths. Now most of us, if we read it at all, read it privately, alone, in our heads. We are estranged from its old meaning and have nothing to replace it. Rituals - rites of passage - take you from one state to another. The birth, the christening or its cultural equivalent, the coming of age, the wedding, the death, the funeral. They are vital in a community. They offer us continuity and coherence; they give us meaning. They offer us the chance to look at ourselves, examine what we have become and where we want to go. So, in the absence of plausible rituals, we make up our own. Do-it-yourself marriages, in a place which has particular meaning for you (underwater, on a hill, soon on the London Eye ...), with words you chose for yourself. Naming ceremonies in place of christenings, because we want to welcome solemnly the new child but we don't want to promise to bring them up as strict Christians or whatever. I once went to a naming ceremony in the wilds of the Peak District. It was raining and the wind took away the words, and the grandmother, in her brimmed church-hat, looked distressed and embarrassed. We have secular funerals, which Jonathan Miller once described as 'scraps and anthologies of poems and bits of music that he or she might have liked, and they sound like benefits for a theatrical charity _ a scrappy, suburban business'. Yet we still need to find a way to say goodbye and to start the process of healing. Even the act of dying used to be ritualised. Kings would do it in public, surrounded by their courtiers who were there to witness their crossing of the threshold. Their last words would be prepared in advance, rehearsed. Now, most people die alone, in a hospital room, unwitnessed. And how could you have a ritual for it, anyhow, when there is, for most of us, no sense of transition, just an ending, a miserable full stop where we had wanted the sentence to continue? And private rituals tend to get a bad name, become strange rumours - Satanic rituals, Masonic rituals. Yet we want them, we want our secular myths, for there is always a tension between our modern, fresh, liberated selves and our yearning for the old and for continuity with our past. There's something dreary about momentous events that are not publicly and ritualistically marked, divorce, for instance, which you get in the post, like a reminder to pay your TV licence or collect from the court as if you are buying a second-class stamp. It's a furtive and ignominious business, and entirely bureau cratic, nothing to do with all that clashing pain. How do you invent a ritual for failure? But I'm sure we will, just as May Day or Hallowe'en were invented. We tend to think of rituals as good, ennobling, lifting us momentarily outside ourselves. They can be repressive and brutal and farcical too; conservative and perverse, tying us into a past from which we want to escape. Fox-hunting is a ritual. The monarchy is rich in ritual and degraded of meaning - all the ermine and the jewels, the carriages and the absurd, fetishistic ceremonies that symbolise a power they no longer have. Rituals can be a way of hanging on to a past which we have outgrown: the hanging-out of the sheet on the wedding night, to see the drops of virgin blood. As Eric Hobsbawm points out in The Invention of Tradition , a society will most cling to rituals as it is changing. The last decade of the nineteenth century and the first decades of the twentieth were cluttered with invented rituals, as the old world and its values slid away. It's a paradoxical task - to hold on to the past and to move into the future; to be tied by the bonds which you sever. And here we stand, in the first days of 2000, looking backwards, looking forwards, looking for meaning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "technology/2000/jan/02/y2k.theobserver", "type": "article", "sectionId": "technology", "sectionName": "Technology", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:20Z", "webTitle": "Computer bug is the absent guest", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jan/02/y2k.theobserver", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/jan/02/y2k.theobserver", "fields": {"bodyText": "A weather centre in Aberdeen and a tide gauge in Portsmouth were the only reported victims of the millennium bug in Britain yesterday as the much-hyped Y2K disaster fizzled out like a damp firework. Aircraft stayed in the skies, water, electricity and gas supplies were not disrupted. From Moldova to Mauritius, the bug was a conspicuous no-show. Apart from a small glitch in nuclear monitoring systems in Japan, some 'minor problems' for French manufacturers, temporary delays in Gambia's tax offices and a handful of non-functioning video recorders, 'war rooms' around the globe enjoyed a mercifully peaceful new year. But Government and industry specialists are warning that when business resumes on Tuesday, new glitches could emerge. In Whitehall's 'blue room', all remained 'boringly quiet', according to one jaded official. Poor Peter Snow, on the BBC's Bug Watch, stood forlornly in front of a back-projected giant cockroach with absolutely nothing to report. Across the globe, the story was the same. By the small hours of yesterday morning, the worldwide Y2K nerve centre in Washington had given the all-clear in more than half of the 170 countries it monitors. In a sea of green lights, only Gambia's 'Government Services' failed a clean bill of health with a problem relating to its tax office which was, apparently, 'not entirely due to Y2K problems'. The Foreign Office was taking hourly updates from 76 embassies around the world, starting with Tonga, farthest east, and ending with the Solomon Islands, the last place to see in the millennium. Foreign Office Minister John Battle said: 'All these initial reports, one hour after the event, showed no major Y2K related problems.' He claimed that Britain had played an international role in averting the bug, through the 58 international seminars with computer scientists organised by the British Council, and the Government's website which gave details of every country's progress in combating the threat. 'We have been seen to be a leader. Other countries are coming to us to say: \"Can you give us advice?\"' Cabinet Office Minister Paddy Tipping dismissed the failure of a tide gauge in Portsmouth harbour and a PC in a weather station in Aberdeen as 'too trivial to mention'. The Government spent \u00a3420m ensuring its own systems were bug free. Half the critical systems are in the Armed Forces. Tipping said: 'Getting senior generals and people high up in the military to take computer issues seriously has been very, very difficult indeed. They had their own problems. They had wars to fight.' He added: 'Some of the worst fears were either designed out or over-hyped. It is still early days and there could be some embedded chips which could cause a problem working their way through the system.' The worst problems may emerge when small businesses reopen on Tuesday. So has the world been caught by a massive Y2K bug con? A job creation scheme for computer consultants, some of whom were on millennium stand-by for as much as \u00a310,000 a day. 'Not at all,' said a Government spokesman yesterday. 'Our banks have spent \u00a31 billion, utilities have spent \u00a3170m and telecoms have spent \u00a3500m on millennium compliance. This was necessary expenditure, not money wasted. The Government did its job in raising the profile of the problem and getting the key industries to clear the hurdle.' According to American technology consultancy the Gartner Group, worldwide governments have spent up to \u00a3375bn worldwide on updating old technology to cope with Y2K. Gartner analyst Andy Kyte had some words of comfort for disappointed doom-mongers: 'Who could have predicted so few problems? But closer analysis will show that so many businesses had shut down for two or three days that really the world's computer systems had been deactivated and will be reactivated in the year 2000 and we still have to wait and see whether under full load, doing all of their transactions, they can cope with normal business.' The advice to all banks and other businesses this weekend was that the as yet untroubled 'war rooms' should not disband but continue monitoring the situation into the week ahead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/02/hunting.ruralaffairs", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:21Z", "webTitle": "Cock-fighting?

The suggestion by Lord Daresbury, chairman of the Masters of Fox Hounds Association, that many people would find hunting less offensive if members of the hunt wore 'warm tweed jackets' rather than their traditional pink is hootingly ridiculous. Unfortunately, it is also probably true. But now it's too late. Even if the master rode to hounds in a donkey-jacket, it wouldn't do much for the pro hunting lobby. Had such sartorially radical action been taken a decade or so ago, who knows? But for the matter to have been raised, and without embarrassment, pinpoints what much of this so-called debate has been about. The trouble with the hunters' coats is that they seem \u00e9litist, militaristic even. Or so Lord Daresbury posits thoughtfully: 'It suggests hierarchy and it is uncomfortable to some people.' My view is that the coats are one of the best things about the hunt. The view of the painting come to life has, at least, aesthetic appeal, which is more than can be said for the rest of it. But that's just my view. Lord Daresbury is, to some extent, a politician and so, reasonably, it is politics, not aesthetics, which count. He pragmatically concludes: 'Perception is important, and if research shows that people are antagonised because of red coats then we should think about changing that.' Yes, perception does count. Throughout history, power lies with those whose view of the world is upheld. I would argue that what feminism is truly about is laying bare the lie that pretends that a partial, male view of the world is universal and the woman's a case of special pleading. But then the people or class who define, whose world-view is implicitly the socially corroborated one, have always had the power and one could cite colonialism generally and the history of the British Empire in particular here. I'd go further. It is in this that power lies. There's no need to get retrospectively bitter or accusatory; it's history and it's politics. Now it is a different class in the ascendant. I don't know how you'd describe this class - urban, unmoneyed (in the traditional sense), mercantile rather than landed. Us. But however this heterodox group is labelled, the fact is that it defines; 'its' world view is now dominant. You can see this in the hunting issue most clearly. The anti-hunting lobby says that hunting is a pastime for nobs. The pro-hunting lobby, defensive as it is on every turn, says actually, no, plumbers hunt too. Or some such. But what can the pro-hunting lot do except try to rebut the charges? No longer can it ignore these charges, because they are now seen to be the charges of society as a whole. The other charge - and it is this one that most of the anti-hunting protesters would insist is the chief one - is that hunting is barbaric and cruel and should be outlawed, just as bear-baiting and cock-fighting have been. I can see this - and the weakness of the pro-hunting lobby is that it seeks to deny it. I think simply that while it is undeniably cruel to let dogs tear a fox limb from limb, it doesn't matter. Is this heresy? Probably. I'm not sure I'd mind a bit of cock-fighting, either. It would certainly be preferable to the institution of the battery coop. Indeed, give me a bit of clich\u00e9d nature red in tooth and claw than intensive farming any day. Believe me, I'm no countryside champion. I'm an urban girl through and through. Baldly, my view is that as long as I'm not made to hunt, I'm not going to prevent any one else from doing so. I don't say this out of Voltairean moral loftiness; far from it. I think that to have infused this whole issue with the moral weight of a generation, of a party, of an entire people, has been the biggest mistake of the current government, and I believe it must know that, too. But maybe it's a sign of socio-political contentment worthy of Macmillan's famous statement, for I certainly can't imagine how wonderful it must be to have so little that is irksome in one's life that the worst, most inflammatory thing is the fact that some foxes get mauled by dogs in the country. What a lucky state of affairs it would be if that were really so. But it isn't so and we should remember that. But, of course, these days political activism has gone, replaced by the animal-rights movement. I do believe in some sense in the rights of animals, but I don't believe that the way animals are treated in order to make cheap meat for us is right or good. But that doesn't mean that an animal's life is of equal value to a human life. If I were a dog, I might disagree, but I'm not - I'm a human being. Then again, if I were a dog I wouldn't have the wherewithal to disagree. You could argue that the people who hold an animal's life as dear or dearer than a human one are not, in the old accusation, class traitors, but species traitors. We might no longer believe that we want to live in a nation fit for heroes, but fit for 'foxes'? I understand that many people are naturally shocked by hunting, not because of what it does to the fox but because of what it does to the people. But in a world which is rife with violence towards people, one could regard this choreographed barbarity as serving a useful purpose. Still, I'm not here to argue the case for hunting - that's certainly not my ticket - but to urge those fighting against it to put their immense and admirable energies to a more useful cause. Most importantly, I think we just have to remind ourselves as we enter the new millennium (come on - you had to allow me just one mention) of the value of being human."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:21Z", "webTitle": "Six billion unite in moment of peace", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk", "fields": {"bodyText": "Just for a moment, it was possible to believe. With all the best parties there comes that one sublime moment, stranded in time, when all things seem possible. When our human frailty and the infinite sadnesses it engenders can be set aside for a few seconds. When all that counts is, simply, that we will remember, with a happy little shock, that we are alive. Before the comedown, before the hangover. When the simple fact that we can breathe, and think, on a blue planet warmed by one of the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way seems the most joyous accident of all eternity. And so it was with the biggest party on the planet, when most of its 600 billion souls stopped, if for one second, to remember that they were alive together, on Earth, the beautiful accident. The hangover has come, as it always does. Already, we have started to kill each other again. Yesterday's dawn brought neither Armageddon nor Paradise. We ate. It rained. Boring things happened, and pompous things happened. The Chinese tried to boast that 'their' millennium had been more significant than any other, coming at the end of 5,000, not 2,000, years of history. London tried to congratulate itself on having hosted the finest party on the globe, when in fact what it had hosted was one expensive, vaguely pleasant, aimless, passion-free crush. But there had been a moment - a minute, five minutes, an hour - when, while celebrating and watching the rest of our planet celebrate, the togetherness was there, and, as we moved together into 1.1.00, there was hope. In this new beginning was the word, but the word was no longer God. It was peace. Peace, on the lips and banners of the millions lining Tiananmen Square; and despite the history, we could, for a moment, believe. Peace, from the tens of thousands at Bombay's Gateway of India monument, as exhausted hostages returned to their families; and we could believe. Peace, from the lips of Moscow, as Grozny further collapsed under a new barrage, and we tried to believe. Peace from America, the land where hundreds spent the night holed up in survivalist boltholes in fear of a UN 'invasion', but still the land where they are outnumbered by the clever and the sane, a million of whom gathered in Times Square; and we could believe. What could we believe? We could believe that, for one moment, all of them at least meant it. And for this, we have to thank television. This is why it was a party like no other; for it was the first time the world could watch itself, as dawn raced across it at 740 miles an hour, and remember how alone on this rock we all are; how dependent on each other for love, or life, or unity, or death; and for a moment we took joy from watching others' celebrations. The technology that gave us TV is, of course, a double-edged sword: its culture both unites and divides us. This was a filmic party, designed for the lens. Thus, while we had that undeniable frisson of shared joy from the other side of the world, it was joy for a people, for a mass of humanity; the individual was mostly forgotten. Thus we had the Moriori natives dancing for eight hours for us on Millennium Island as that first dawn approached. And, as an image, it worked perfectly, and united us with a sense of wonder; but we thought little of the people there; of the fact the race has been invaded and slaughtered with unceasing routine down the centuries; of the women having to strap themselves, for the benefit of Western sensibilities, into what looked like canvas bras from the time of the Naafi demob, of the dozens of camera crews perched, smoking, higher up the beach. Thus, too, in London, while the world gazed on the 'home of time' and allegedly marvelled at the slick, professional presentation at the Dome, and listened rapt - and rightly so - to John Tavener's rather beautiful anthem - there were exhausted families, close to tears, still queuing in the shambles outside. One pleasant, mild-mannered charity worker from Plymouth, denied his half-bottle of champers for the midnight toast because someone had locked the caged container (and because someone else, in Mr Tony's New Britain, had ordered all the Dome's bars to be closed at 10.30), was trying to wrestle the metal open with help from a security guard; both were bleeding. When the Queen - shortly before demonstrating to the Western world that she is perhaps the one person alive in it who does not know how to link arms to 'Auld Lang Syne' - officially opened the Dome, to oohs and aahs from behind TV screens throughout her land, I missed it: I was bending over a Chelsea pensioner who had collapsed, and had been waiting for attention for more than 20 minutes because security couldn't find a doctor. Perhaps every country simply got the millennium it deserved. In the Phillipines, and in South Africa, killings were taking place on their respective strokes of midnight. Australia and France quietly trumped the world with the glory of their fireworks, and the spontaneity of celebrations. The most peaceful place in the world was, bizarrely, Kosovo. In Rio, three million gathered on Copacabana beach, and millennial sex was had. In Rome, police spent the night confiscating 4.5 million illegal fireworks, and the Pope launched a spiritual task force to lead the world in a year of repentance. (He was something of a lone voice; 2,000 years of continued non-reappearance after the alleged birth of Christ, he still didn't have a massive look-in. In the Dome, the Archbishop of Canterbury was given a mere two minutes to talk about him; the crowd spent more time paying homage to the Queen and singing the words of John Lennon. In Washington, tens of thousands stayed at home in case they were blown up, a European terrorist having been arrested in North America three weeks ago. In Edinburgh, they started partying when the pubs opened in the morning, and ended up forcibly snogging policewomen. In London, the English did what the English do best. They queued. It was a safe night in the capital, for which some thanks should be due, but it was a pretty orthodox night; memorable only for the occasion, not for the festivities. Reactions have been mixed; those of London's eight million who stayed at home with good friends, or watched the river from a high vantage-point, had a good night; but many of those who went down to the river, or to the Dome, enjoyed little more than six hours of jammed queues, frayed tempers and mild drunks. Drinks, seats, food, toilets - all seemed impossible to find along the Embankment. But all was well with the camera positions, so at least the rest of the world could watch London trying to have a good time. The dilemma of the media age; it seems easier to raise your glass to the TV and, with a tear in the eye, wish a Happy New Year to a stranger on the other side of the world than it does to turn round to your neighbour on the riverbank and hug them. There was not much hugging in the Dome, but perhaps that was the nature of the event. Of the 10,000 specially invited guests there seemed a remarkably high percentage of middle-class Christians and people in wheelchairs, and a remarkably low percentage of blacks (until the latter came on after midnight to entertain us, as did the dancers in the aerial ballet, a distressingly beautiful event which will live in the memory). But it was an odd event, with some odd people - as artificial snow fell from the top of the dome, refreshing and delighting most of us below, the women in front of me tutted and then strapped on first her headscarf and then, with a growl, her rain cap. It was neither an event for the rich nor for the poor, the beautiful nor the damned, the Christian nor the secular; the music and the messages were all gloriously mixed. (Outside the arena, in the Money Zone - all the zones being, of course, corporately financed - the wall was adorned with hundreds of quotes about money, including Bill Vaughan's. 'It would be nice if the poor were to get even half the money that is spent studying them' - all helpfully free of irony, or belief, or principles). So, all in all, the perfect Blairite millennium. And then, in that next dawn, be it Kiribatu's purple clouds or the smudgy Saturday grey of London, the world continued to turn. On the islands, the cameras went home. At Kings Cross, drunks fought and rubbish stank. Nothing had really changed. Oh, but it had. Carping apart, all the daily poisons of life put aside for a second, something had changed: we had been there, and we had seen each other being there. All six billion of us, we were there, and we were together alive, and it was good to be alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk18", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:22Z", "webTitle": "All I want for the millennium is...", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk18", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk18", "fields": {"bodyText": "Ann Pettifor, Director of Jubilee 2000, which campaigns for an end to Third World debt My fervent hope is for a Copernican shift: from a money-centred world to a human-centred world.

Lord Peter Melchett, Executive director of Greenpeace We have to meet our needs without poisoning, eroding, burning and destroying the systems that support all life on earth.

Lembit Opik, MP for Montgomeryshire, Liberal Democrat spokesman on Ulster I'm glad to say 'bye' to the Black Death, most slavery, the Troubles (c 1540-1999), some famine, some war, Krakatoa and the Bay City Rollers. Next millennium, I hope we say 'yes' to colonising the solar system, a Grand Unified Theory of Physics, a better sense of what God's all about, less war, and at a personal level, better health for my mother.

Darcus Howe, Broadcaster I hope for absolute equality and a revitalisation of English cricket. Chris Holmes, Director of Shelter The millennium marks 2000 years from the day when the Christian Church remembers the birth of Jesus in a stable - because there was 'no room in the inn'. It is a scandal that in a society as rich as Britain today, more than 2,000 homeless people sleep on the streets every night, and almost 7,000 homeless families will spend this Christmas in bed and breakfast hotels. My hope is that we will enable everyone to live in a decent, safe and affordable home - and that we make a commitment for that to be possible for people throughout the world. Mark Thomas, Broadcaster and comedian I would like Cherie Blair to give birth to a black baby. I also hope there will be an anarcho-zen transfer of power from those that have it to those that don't. I would like to see the back of everything to do with Chris Tarrant and Christianity. There should be a rehabilitation scheme for priests to help them pack it in and the empty churches should be turned into theme pubs. All the gold crucifixes and rings could be melted into a huge block, reading 'Sorry - we were wrong'. Jo Hamilton, Member of environmental pressure group Genetix Snowball My hopes: people co-operating to take positive action to create a just and diverse world; an end to cynicism, isolation and the mono-culture of global capitalism. The Dalai Lama, Religious leader The most important thing is transforming our minds, so that we have a new way of thinking and a new outlook. We should make an effort to develop a new inner world. For centuries, and for generations, humanity has invested all its effort into developing society in terms of material facilities, on the basis of science and technology. The world at large, and particularly the Western nations, have achieved very high living standards, yet a lot of problems remain. Barbara Follett,MP for Stevenage New ways of thinking and new ways of doing are my hopes. Out with the old 'this is how we have always done it' dogma and in with the 'let's try it this way' approach. Adrian Noble, Artistic director, Royal Shakespeare Company As the new technology and digitalisation transform our society, I would like to see a recognition of the increasingly important role of live performance. Theatre can be a spiritually revitalising, politically alert and exhilarating medium, but we need to safeguard the future by securing the training of our young artists, properly rewarding our writers, and accepting once and for all that subsidy can directly contribute to our democracy, in a civilising as well as pecuniary way. We must also be willing to redefine our role in society, seeking new structures and not clinging to the past, but recognising that the artist is part visionary, part showman, part educator and part trouble-maker. Martin Bell, MP for Tatton I hope for a more peaceful future in which civilians aren't targeted in warfare, the Geneva Convention is observed and children can live their childhood in peace and freedom. Luciana Morad, Mother of the latest addition to Mick Jagger's growing family, Lucas. I am looking forward to seeing my son's first steps and a happier and more sincere world. Helen Carey,Chairman of the Women's Institutes We all need to have an understanding of our world, the countryside, the environment and the part we can play in it. This is why I believe so strongly in Agenda 21- the action plan for a sustainable way of life that involves and empowers people to make decisions for their own communities. Alan Bleasdale, Playwright I would wish for the defeat of racism and nationalism; for the ending of Third World debt; for advances in medicine that save people's lives rather than enhance the prospects of longevity for the rich. On a personal level, I would like a teddy bear to go with those childish hopes and dreams. Glenda Jackson, MP for Hampstead and Highgate There is one thing I would like to see finally arrive: women are half the population of the world and should be sitting in half the legislative seats in the world. Paul Thompson, Director of the Design Museum At a local level I look forward to the introduction of decent bus and cycle lanes within our city centres; a greater understanding of the significance of design and technology within the National Curriculum; and a secure future for our green belts, underpinned by EU support for organic farming. At a global level: an end to the nineteenth-century concept of the nation-state and the consequent ethnic cleansing. John Humphrys, Presenter, Radio 4 My hope: that politicians of all hues will finally realise we have only one countryside and if they screw it up any more it will be past recovery. That's nothing to do with fox-hunting and everything to do with trees and hedges and chemical pollution. Michael Dibdin, Author Welcome to an integrated European Union containing over 500 million of the brightest and best people on earth, each speaking two other EU languages and understanding at least three others. Farewell to the horrors which made this both possible and necessary. Ben Gill, President of the National Farmers' Union My wish is for a new-found return of optimism to British farmers based on sustainable farm incomes to secure the core maintenance of our rural communities and our beautiful British countryside. Terence Conran, Designer, retailer, restaurateur The new millennium will bring a new governing body for London - long overdue, much needed, and headed up, I hope, by a democratically elected, popular mayor: no stooges or bearded poodles, please. And as we leave the twentieth century, I hope we will be able to wave goodbye to mean-spirited new housing that eats up the countryside, further divides the haves from the have-nots and insists on clich\u00e9d detailing such as coachlamps and Tudorbethan beams. Martha Lane Fox, Founder of Lastminute.com I would like to see more and more excitement about what the web can enable. It is such a dynamic industry and I think that 2000 could be the year that the web becomes mainstream, but there needs to be a collective responsibility among web companies to deliver on their promises of excellent service. I would also like to see more women in e-business, and for prices to fall. Dawn Airey, Director of programmes, Channel 5 I hope 2000 starts with a miracle: critics acknowledging what Channel 5 has achieved in both business and creative terms on budgets that barely equal some corporations' expense accounts. I hope that the combination of movies, mating, matches and much more continues to bring commercial success for our shareholders and that I remain working with the most talented team in broadcasting. Mariella Frostrup, Broadcaster I'd like to see the Internet - a medium that was supposed to enfranchise everyone and usher in a utopia of information and education, and has so far only created a few young millionaires - actually make good on its potential and create the global village we were all expecting. Andrew Motion, Poet Laureate My hopes are all wearied by repetition - wearied but undaunted: peacefulness; greater equality; mutual respect and understanding; a curb to global capitalism; the cancellation of Third World Debt. John Simpson, BBC world affairs editor What would give me the greatest pleasure to report on in the next two or three years is an end to the wars in Afghanistan and Angola. These wars are entirely unnecessary and could be stopped within a week with a minimum of diplomatic effort and money from Western governments. John Monks, General secretary, TUC Over the next century I want to see trade unionism as relevant to millions more workers as it has been in the past century. This means in the UK trade unions penetrating IT, call centre, leisure and hospitality industries. Worldwide, it means recognising that globalisation must be accompanied by the spread of decent environmental, labour and social standards - not as an afterthought but as a condition. James Boyle, Controller, Radio 4 We should all hope for an end to the poison of racism which has blighted the last 2000 years. Let's see if we can do better with the original messages of charity and humility. Professor Steve Jones, University College, London My hope is that science will not be seen as a calling, a hobby, a privilege or a vocation, but a profession. I would love to see the back of the weasel-words that deny a career to most young scientists on the dishonest grounds that the best will survive, but I fear that the hypocrisy of the elders will last until British science wastes away. Stephen Twigg, MP for Enfield, Southgate The greatest horror of the past century was the Nazi Holocaust. We must never ever forget what happened. I warmly welcome plans to have an annual Holocaust Remembrance Day - to remind people of the past and to challenge prejudice and bigotry in the present and the future. Alexei Sayle, Comedian I'll be glad to see the back of the environment, all that biodiversity and stuff got on my wick. I'm looking forward to a Bladerunner-style future, all noodle bars and giant adverts so I can replace my friends with replicants that look like Rutger Hauer and who'll be nice to me. Gaby Roslin, TV presenter My most fervent hopes are for peace and an end to racism and suffering around the globe. On a personal note, I wish for an end to early morning starts - no more 4am calls for me. John O'Farrell, Author of Things Can Only Get Better I'd like to see an end to gardening make-over programmes. Instead I'd like to see the same format used to do up Third World countries. Carol Smillie has one weekend to take an impoverished sub-Saharan dictatorship and, with a bit of MDF and some crazy paving, convert it into a prosperous Western democracy. Iqbal Sacrannie, Secretary-general, Muslim Council of Britain I think one looks forward to a better understanding and dialogue between Islam and the West. We need to work and live together and this can only happen if we understand each other. Muslim communities worldwide have a major role to play - we have to project ourselves in the character and performance of our duties according to the teachings of Islam. My final hope is that people will not be discriminated against on the basis of their faith. Graham Norton, TV presenter I hope dogs get passports, and a benign terrorist force puts Prozac in the world's water supplies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk11", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:22Z", "webTitle": "Patrolling a small world", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk11", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk11", "fields": {"bodyText": "'Wherever you are, whatever you're doing, the BBC is with you,' they promised us at 10am on 31 December, at the start of what may have been terrestrial TV's big, brave last gasp. Through Friday and Saturday, some 28 hours of television took the viewer on an awesome, globe-shrinking journey - a technological hand-across-the-water and a fitting end to a century of bombastic imagery. There were glitches, but remarkably few. The triumphs tended to be quiet, if only because silence and space are such precious commodities in a medium that necessarily abhors a vacuum; while the big bangs were markedly less successful - fireworks do not, on the whole, make great TV. And there were a lot of fireworks. After what sounded like a miserable five days on a tramp steamer travelling to Kiribati from Christmas Island, John Simpson pitched up on a coral beach under the stars and gave us the first midnight, in the South Pacific, at 10am. The region's President, Simpson told us, had come to power on the promise that he would reorganise the international dateline so that the islands were no longer divided by time; while Tonga had allocated themselves another hour of daylight saving just so that it could become the first inhabited place to usher in all our tomorrows. Back in the fussy, over-designed BBC studio - Was that a Charlie Dimmock water feature? Why the gauche rune-style 2000 logo? - anchors Michael Parkinson and Gaby Roslin proved a surprisingly successful combination. Gaby wore five different outfits, gushed and was regularly, if mostly just professionally, 'moved'; while Parky kicked off just this side of businesslike and ended up, rather deliciously, quite excited. Meanwhile, Peter Snow struggled with a sore throat as he kept a weather eye for potential millennium buggery, and Peter Sissons reminded us, if we cared, that there was some other news in the world out there - Yeltsin's resignation, the end of the Indian Airline hostage crisis, George Harrison's party-pooping partially collapsed lung. Messy lives apparently continued to unfold even as we marked time, waiting for something bigger. Then it was Britain's midday: 'The next time it strikes 12 after this it will be the start of the millennial year. Gosh, we're full of trivial information here!' said Sissons, cheerily. Gaby was moved by the idea of the last midday, but Parky was non-plussed. A sudden spate of firsts: weddings, bungee jumps and babies in New Zealand. And no millennial meltdown. Yet. 'How is your throat, Peter?' Gaby asked Snow. 'Quite interesting,' he replied before telling that, having come through Red Alert (high risk), Amber (a bit of risk) we were now on a Blue millennium bug alert. Barely any risk at all, apparently. At a Sikh temple in Leicester we learnt that it was 2056 in the Hindu calendar. And that Lerwick has more musicians per head of the population than anywhere other than Nashville. Lots of people were getting married in Beijing, and there were police boats breathalysing revellers on the water in Sydney Harbour. The world was shrinking so fast we needed more and more on-screen information about where we were. I cried when it was Sydney's turn - my mother and brother live nearby. But Sydney threw down the pyrotechnological gauntlet and looked stunning. Hours later, on ITV, Bob Geldof told Trevor McDonald, 'Ours will be bigger than Sid's'. Had I misheard? No, it turned out that Sid was, fittingly, the pyrotechnician in charge of lighting Sydney. Not that this was meant to be a competition, surely? Gloom in Muckle Flugga, Britain's first sunset ('When you see that, you think there might be another world,' said Peter Sissons, caught up in it now), acts of remembrance in Nottingham, sunset-chasing in Tornado jets. Michael Palin, OBE, turned up to show us Bj\u00f6rk in Reykjavik, Inca ceremonies at Macchu Pichu, stiltwalkers at Uluru, a German boys choir at sunset in Nazareth, while at 4.16pm Gaby told us, 'Now it's time to beat the retreat in Plymouth with Angela Rippon.' I was getting a bit dizzy, teary. Two thousand voices sang Danny Boy in Ulster and people were starting to cheer in the street outside my flat. The big quiz, 2000 to One, turned out to be a damp squib because Duncan, the bearded man who looked exactly like Jesus, was beaten by John, who wore a sensible sweater. John was a 'personal empowerment coach'. How very 1999. According to presenter Tim Vincent, 'the greatest party the world has ever seen' was in Cardiff. I doubted that. 'It's beginning to build up to something now, isn't it?' admitted Parky at 9pm - midnight in Moscow. There was another picture of the Auckland baby, born at 12.01 NZ time, but we still didn't know what gender it was, though it was obviously more of a metaphor than a baby. Then we were in South Africa. Michael Buerk couldn't stop himself from talking, non-stop and knowledgeably, but I wished he'd shut up because this was one of those quiet, understated moments that really could have moved both me and Gaby. No fireworks, just Nelson Mandela returning to his old cell at Robben Island to light a candle. It was in stark contrast to the Queen's efforts to light a Thames-side fuse a little later. Lighters and candles tend to do the job, but London was in danger of getting caught out by the grand, empty gesture. It may be the year 5760 for Jews, but over in Bethlehem they played Also Sprach Zarathustra - the theme from 2001 - so it still felt like the wrong year; while Jean Michel Jarre was doing a big and pompous son et lumi\u00e8re at the Pyramids, so it felt a bit like 1980. At 11pm, I switched over to ITN and Trevor McDonald. As The Bay City Rollers sang 'I Only Want To Be With You' in Edinburgh, in Paris the Eiffel Tower was giving off white sparks. We could do better than that, surely? Inside the Dome with the Queen and Tony Blair, the atmosphere never looked very merry and a phone call from a Dome-bound friend - 'The bar is shut already!' - seemed to confirm it. No, the River looked the place to be, though John Suchet told us there were worries about crowd safety. Midnight. I wanted to feel something more than I felt, but I was tired with anticipation. ITV hedged its bets by splitting the screen three ways: Bongs from Big Ben, the River of Fire and a tiny McDonald in the top right-hand corner. Less would have been more, but I think Geldof was right, we did beat Sydney - not that it was ever a competition, surely? And then, shockingly suddenly, I realised I had been taken into tomorrow and that there was probably never going to be an antidote to the sense of anti-climax because I hadn't looked that far ahead. The only response was to hit the Off button and sleep while somewhere else celebrated because, of course, it really didn't matter anymore.

Unlike everyone else, we'd decided not to celebrate the achievements of the past 10 centuries by honking bubbly into the Thames. Instead, we were going to make this the greatest weekend of all time \u0085 Thursday 3pm We are ready. We have consulted all the lists of the best things of the millennium and made the ultimate selection. We've rented the best film: Citizen Kane. 'Stairway To Heaven' is in the glove box. We've bought the best invention: a zip. It's all going swimmingly. Anglesey here we come! 11.32pm We arrive at our cottage and unpack the Fiat. Peter drops Hamlet in a puddle, then puts Only Fools and Horses in the VCR: the episode containing the greatest TV moment of the past 1,000 years. Peter goes to sleep on the sofa with a knife under his pillow. After all, this is Wales and you can't take chances. Friday 9.04am The Sanyo booms. 'There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is\u0085' Peter sits bolt upright and hurls a knife at the wall. We nod in appreciation of the best song of the millennium, and fill a pot with its greatest food: beans. From here on, everything we do, eat, read or see has been voted the very best of the millennium. Peter reads from If while Charlie dishes up the Heinz. Charlie salutes the greatest breakfast of the millennium with a swig of Coke and a toke on a Lambert and Butler. 9.55am Kane time! We close the curtains, and switch on the greatest movie of all time. Orson Welles, newspapers: it's got it all. The credits roll\u0085 Fuck, it's in black and white! We hit eject and slap in Fools and Horses. Del Boy falls through the bar. Brilliant! 12.15pm Time for millennium roleplay. We draw names from a bowler hat. Charlie gets Muhammad Ali, strips down to his boxers and thumps Peter on the arm. Peter was hoping for Ali G, but gets Galileo. In tribute to the great Italian astronomer, Peter heads upstairs with a pair of binoculars and trains them on the cottage across the marsh. He's in need of company, and the figures moving in the upstairs window look like girls. 2.30pm Peter turns on the three-bar fire and we settle down on the sofa with Hamlet: the greatest literary achievement of the millennium. We're so engrossed in this masterpiece that we lose all track of time. 2.37pm Del Boy falls through the bar. Brilliant! 4.45pm Charlie spends some time contemplating the best picture of the millennium. It's an extraordinary portrait: the enigmatic smile, the eyes which seem to follow you around the room. Mystery surrounds the identity of the model. Chances are Athena found him in a gay bar and paid him a tenner to cradle the baby with his top off. 11.57pm To avoid having to use the phrase 'Happy Y2K', Charlie goes to bed with Dickens. Peter raises a glass of Coca-Cola to the contraceptive pill, and washes down a month's supply. He's asleep and dribbling before the countdown begins. Saturday 9.40am A new era. Charlie comes downstairs to find Peter in the kitchen, hunched over a saucepan, ragging down his breasts with warm milk. 'They've swollen,' sobs Peter. 'Don't worry,' says Charlie, 'we packed a Wonderbra.' 2.55pm Peter is on the sofa, playing with a zip. He seems content. 'This revolutionised the button.' Charlie nods then somersaults across the lounge, into some golf clubs. 'No time for that now - we've got a moon landing to recreate.' 3.20pm 'Moon to Earth,' calls Charlie from the garden, recreating the greatest achievement of mankind, 'can you hear me loud and clear?' Peter can't. He's caught his nipple in the zip, and the pain has made him deaf. Charlie leaps from the wheelbarrow, plants a flag, wees into the air and takes a soil sample. 'Holyhead, we have a problem.' 10.16pm Newport Pagnell service station. We fill the Fiat and split the first Ginsters of the new millennium. We rejoin the M1 and head south. There's no question: this has been the best weekend of all time. Peter turns up the stereo. We hear a familiar tune. 'There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is\u0085 ' We clip the central reservation and ping across the lanes into some scrub. We sob. A trembling hand reaches across and cups Peter's breast.

They are an attractive couple - a boy emperor and his old teacher, the intellectual pope. Together they decided to bring back the Christian empire that Charlemagne had tried to create among the warring tribes of Western Europe. If Charlemagne was the Jean Monnet of the 800s, Otto III was the Romano Prodi of the 900s. Otto was only 14 when he became king of Germany. From boyhood, he took very seriously the idea of a united Christendom, a Holy Roman Empire. Like so many over-active, over-educated boys of that period, he was a natural general, winning battles in a Germany that rather resembled the China of Confucius's era, a time known as that of 'the warring duchies'. By 16, King Otto was crowned Emperor of the West. An intellectual snob, he despised what he called 'Saxon rusticity' and he favoured what he termed Greek or Byzantine 'subtlety'. He even dreamed of sailing to Byzantium to bring together all Christendom under his rule, which was, in turn, under that of God. In this sublime enterprise, he was guided by his old tutor, a French scholar named Gerbert. As a sign of solidarity - not to mention morbidity - Otto even opened up the tomb of Charlemagne and paid his great predecessor a visit. The dead emperor was seated on a throne. According to an eyewitness, only a bit of his nose had fallen off but his fingernails had grown through his gloves and so, reverently, Otto pared them and otherwise tidied him up. Can one imagine Prodi - or even Schr\u00f6der - doing as much for the corpse of Monnet? Now we approach the fateful year 999. Otto is 19. He is obsessed with Italy. With Rome. With empire. In that year, he sees to it that Gerbert is elected pope, taking the name Sylvester. Now emperor and pope move south to the decaying small town of Rome, where Otto builds himself a palace on the Aventine, a bad luck hill, as Cicero could have testified. Together, Otto and Sylvester lavished their love and their ambition upon the Romans, who hated both of them with a passion. In the year that our millennium properly began, 1001, the Romans drove emperor and pope out of the city. Otto died at 22, near Viterbo, of smallpox. A year later, Sylvester was dead, having first, it is said, invented the organ. Thus, the dream of a European union ended in disaster for the two dreamers. I will not go so far as to say that the 1,000 years since Otto's death have been a total waste of time. Certainly, other dreamers have had similar centripetal dreams. But those centrifugal forces that hold us in permanent thrall invariably undo the various confederacies, leagues, empires, 1,000-year reichs that the centripetalists would impose upon us from the top down. Recently, the literary critic Harold Bloom, in the somewhat quixotic course of trying to establish a Western literary canon, divided human history into phases that cyclically repeat. First, he says, there is a theocratic age, next an aristocratic age, followed by a democratic age, which degenerates into chaos, out of which some new idea of divinity will emerge to unite us all in a new theocratic age, and the cycle begins again. Bloom rather dreads the coming theocratic age, but since he - and I - will never see it, we can settle comfortably into the current chaos where the meaning of meaning is an endlessly cozy subject and Heisenberg's principle is the undisputed law of the land, at least from where each of us is situated. As we ponder the adventures of Otto and Sylvester, we must note the cyclic nature of the way human society evolves as originally posited by Plato in the eighth book of the Republic and further developed by Giovanni Battista Vico in his Scienza Nuova. Professor Bloom goes straight to Vico, an early-eighteenth-century Neapolitan scholar who became interested in the origins of Roman law. The deeper Vico got into the subject, the further back in time he was obliged to go, specifically, to Greece. Then he got interested in how the human race was able to create an image of itself for itself. At the beginning, there appears to have been an animistic belief in the magic of places and in the personification of the elements as gods. To Vico, these legends, rooted in prehistory, were innate wisdom. But then the age of the gods was challenged by the rise of individual men. Suddenly, kings and heroes are on the scene. They give birth to oligarchies, to an aristocratic society where patricians battle for first place in the state. In time, the always exciting game of who will be king of the castle creates a tyranny that will inspire the people at large to rebel against the tyrants and establish republics that, thanks to man's nature, tend to imperial acquisitiveness. In due course, these empire-republics meet their natural terminus in, let us say, the jungles of Vietnam. What happens next? Vico calls the next stage Chaos, to be followed by a new theocratic age. This process is, of course, pure Hinduism, which was never to stop leaking into Greek thought from Pythagoras to the Neo-Platonists and even now into the collective consciousness of California surfers and ceramicists as well as disciples of the good Allen Ginsberg. Birth, death, chaos, then rebirth and so on and on and on. But though Vico's mind was brilliant and intuitive, the history that he had to deal with necessarily left out science as we know it and he did not. Now we must ponder how chaos may yet organise itself through technology as the means of ultimate control over everyone, even as it seems, currently, to serve China's lively millions as a step toward liberation. Chaos - our current condition - may prove to be too interesting to make order of. Will the next god be a computer? In which case, a tyrant god for those of us who dwell in computer-challenged darkness. A characteristic of our present chaos is the dramatic migration of tribes. They are on the move from East to West, from South to North. Liberal tradition requires that borders must always be open for those in search of safety or even the pursuit of happiness. In the case of the United States, the acquisition of new citizens from all the tribes of Earth has always been thought to be a very good thing. But with so many billions of people on the move, even the great-hearted may well become edgy once we have gobbled up all the computer-proficient immigrants. As we start the third millennium of what we in our Western section of the globe are amused to call the Christian era, we should be aware that most of the world's tribes are, happily for them, not Christian at all. Also, most of us who are classified as Christians and live in nations where this form of monotheism was once all-powerful now live in a secular world. So chaos does have its pleasures. But then as Christian presuppositions do not mean anything to others (as Buddhists reminded the current pope when on holiday in Sri Lanka), so, too, finally, Plato and his perennially interesting worldview don't make much sense when applied to societies such as ours. Great centrifugal forces are now at work in nearly every nation-state and why resist them? For the centripetally minded - theocratic or imperial or both - the mosaic of different tribes that will occupy Europe, let us say, from homely Bantry to glittering Vladivostok, are eventually bound to come together in the interest of mundane trade. Is not that quite enough? At least in the absence of a new god. Nevertheless, as the curtain falls on our dismal century and ungraspable millennium, one sees on every side, to the East, West, North and South of Tiananmen Square, signs of religious revival. Everywhere, gods are rising from their musty tombs, plucking stakes from their black hearts, awful eyes aglitter in every land as they commence their war on that old night and chaos which has given such comforting shelter to shy diversity. One also recalls, in the last century, a speaker of the American House of Representatives who was so reactionary that it was said of him: 'If he had been consulted by God about creation, he would have voted for chaos.' Considering the alternatives, for now at least, who would not?

But at least one British bible scholar, Ormond Edwards, believes the celebrations in Bethlehem's Manger Square yesterday, which made up in fierce joy what they lacked in numbers or multi-million pound pyro-technics, were, after all, the right rites at the right time. In his new book, Dating the Millennium, the product of years poring over the differences between the gospels of Luke and Matthew and trying to fix the crucial date of King Herod's death, he concludes that Jesus was, after all, born in 1BC. It was debatable how much accuracy mattered to the tens of thousands of Christians - pilgrims, tourists, priests and members of the ancient Palestinian Christian community - who thronged the little Manger Square, its millennium makeover not quite finished, to cheer in the new year. Even Muslims, for whom Friday was the last day of Ramadan, a great holiday, were drawn into the festivities. 'The Christians and Muslims have been here in Bethlehem for centuries and centuries. We're brothers. There's no difference between us,' said Fathi Kanan, a bank worker sitting in the shade on the edge of the square yesterday, watching a stream of tourists coming and going from the Church of the Nativity, said to be built over the spot where Jesus was born. 'It was great fun. Fantastic. Everyone was dancing and laughing. I was dancing, and so was all my family.' For Bethlehem, now under the control of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, the millennium celebrations were, its people hope, a prelude to the even bigger party due to follow later this year when an independent Palestine emerges. The Palestinian national flag hung from lampposts on the road leading into Bethlehem, alongside symbols and coloured lights with a religious theme. The traffic lights weren't working yesterday morning, but it wasn't because of the phantom menace of the millennium bug: they hadn't worked before, either. The Palestinians have a lot of work to do, and hoped the media attention on the New Year's Eve Bethlehem party would encourage the donors to keep on giving. Arafat himself saw in the new year in Gaza City, confirming to the largest rally since his return from exile in 1994 that Palestine would be independent this year. Elsewhere, the Israelis' massive security operation at sensitive sites such as Temple Mount, in the Old City, the Mount of Olives - where the Second Coming of Christ is supposed to occur - and Megiddo, the Biblical Armageddon, paid off. Hundreds of thousands of Muslims came and went from the renowned Al-Aqsa mosque for Ramadan prayers on New Year's Eve without a single incident. For Israel's Jewish majority, it was the Sabbath, which runs from dusk on Friday to dusk on Saturday. In religiously observant Jewish west Jerusalem, bars and restaurants were eerily shuttered and dark, and hotels were forbidden to have parties with music or freshly cooked food on pain of losing their kosher certificates. But in hedonistic Tel Aviv, the Big Orange as the Israelis like to call it, secular Jews joined in the party. Standing eating a stuffed pitta bread at an outdoor millennium party close to the Mount of Olives, Father Maroun Lahham, rector of a Catholic seminary in Jerusalem, said this year might be 1420 for Muslims and 5760 for Jews, but in reality, they used the Western calendar. 'Today, when the Chief Rabbi writes his first letter, he'll date it 1 January 2000, and the Great Mufti of Jerusalem will date his 1 January 2000. So practically everybody is starting a new millennium. But for that very reason, it does have pretty much a purely social meaning.' The feared outrages or mass suicides by exalted Christians seduced by Jerusalem's atmosphere and history into making a new Bible story, with themselves as leading players, did not materialise. On the Mount of Olives, thick with Israeli police officers, an American man was jumped on and led away when he proclaimed himself at midnight to be God's messenger, and two British pilgrims were detained near the Golden Gate - where the returned Messiah will supposedly enter Jerusalem - when they began behaving erratically. One started to fulminate about how bar codes on people's shopping were the mark of the beast. A prayer vigil was held in the Basilica of Gethsemane at the foot of the Mount of Olives, where according to the Bible Jesus waited to be betrayed by Judas. Afterwards, thousands of Christians, led by a police van and flanked by heavily armed Israeli troops, formed a ragged column and marched, carrying candles and a large wooden cross, to the garden of a Christian guesthouse for a millennium party. Franciscan friars in rough brown habits sang in Latin as the cross swung through the warm night, smelling of dust and leaves. In the garden, the cross was set erect, hymns were sung, and there was a countdown to midnight. Stuffing himself with his falafel-filled pitta, Father Maroun seemed quite relieved that Jesus had not, as a few fervent Christians hoped, decided to join the party. 'Now we are in the year 2000 and nothing has happened. I really hope everybody will be reasonable,' he said, looking into the dark groves around him, where light glinted off the eyes and time-worn gun barrels of watchful Israeli soldiers. 'I believe He will come again, and I believe nobody knows the hour. It could be now. It could be in a million years. I don't see any link between 2000 and Jesus Christ.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk15", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:22Z", "webTitle": "Canap\u00e9s after the deluge", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk15", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk15", "fields": {"bodyText": "'Look, look!' said Jean-Jacques Rivalle, a delighted postman from the northern Paris suburbs, to his nine-year-old son Christophe, as 20,000 lightbulbs on the Eiffel Tower began to pop, whirl and pulse just before midnight. 'Remember this - you must remember this moment all your life.' He was on Paris's most famous avenue, crammed with what seemed like as many foreigners as Parisians. It was somehow appropriate for a country still so battered by last week's storms, in which 83 died, that the Prime Minister had cancelled his New Year's Eve reception in sympathy, and the Interior Minister urged everyone to ignore the holiday and work flat out to repair the damage. But little of the pre-millennial dampener was in evidence on the Champs Elys\u00e9es on Friday night, where close to a million people partied beneath 11 giant and very Gallic Ferris wheels stretching from the Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe. 'This is still the most beautiful city in the world,' said Jane Miller from Tucson, Arizona. 'Where else would I be on such a night? And what's more, you can overeat to your heart's content.' Food was, inevitably, at the centre of the capital's celebrations. At Taillevent near the Place de l'Etoile, which has kept its three Michelin stars for nearly three decades and was fully booked for millennium night by summer 1995, 150 gourmets paid rather more than \u00a3300 a head to see in the new year in the most French of ways. Lobster in salted butter was followed by turbot in caviar and watercress. The hub of the feast was lamb, served with truffle flakes in a delicate pastry crust. Across town at La Tour d'Argent, chef Bernard Guilhaudin had devised a \u00a3200 spectacular involving petites bouch\u00e9es au caviar, a scallop soup flavoured with P\u00e9rigord truffles, lobster, duck in vintage burgundy, foie gras and peach flamb\u00e9e. At the Lido, the famous high-kicking cabaret on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, a full house in evening dresses and dinner jackets had forked out \u00a3550 each for the floorshow and a six-course menu. Guest of honour was a 92-year-old grandmother who had blown most of her savings on inviting 16 members of her family. Outside, security was tight as the police feared revellers might turn nasty in the crush, as some did after France's World Cup victory. The entire city force of 10,000 was on duty and in evidence, as well as 40 units of riot police and roving officers drafted in from other regions. A hundred supervisors gathered in an underground bunker to watch tapes from 350 video surveillance cameras around the city. In the event, the atmosphere on the Champs was joyous, not threatening. 'Bonne ann\u00e9e, bonne ann\u00e9e,' was the cry. The Interior Ministry reported just 40 arrests for minor offences and some 230 slight injuries. Outside the capital, villages across France deprived of electricity did their best with salmon, cold cuts and candles. 'It's a bit dismal, but at least everyone's alive,' said Maryvonne Sauveur from Surg\u00e8res in Charente-Maritime, the d\u00e9partement that suffered most from last week's vicious storms. But she and everyone else in France who marked the passage to the 21st century in conditions more reminiscent of the 19th could at least take comfort from the goodwill gesture of the national electricity board: all those without power on millennium night will get a year's free electricity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk16", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:22Z", "webTitle": "Befuddled masses party on as terror threat fizzles out", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk16", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk16", "fields": {"bodyText": "The \u00e9lite, insisted Adam Pinto, a lawyer, had come not to Times Square where the crowds had gathered and the crystal ball dropped, but to the bridge. The bridge across the East River. Across the millennia. Into Manhattan, with a decent view of the most audacious project ever conceived by man, certainly during the outgoing century: the megalopolis to which the dawn of the modern age had given birth. 'I came here because it's a bridge, and I think it's the right place to be,' said Adam. 'Bridges are about getting from one place to another.' It is a mighty construction, praised by the Russian poet Mayakovsky as symbol of the modern order, and now a distance away from the m\u00eal\u00e9e in downtown Manhattan, which was being illuminated from within by the boom of fireworks and the gasp of two million people. But crowded nonetheless. Not least with Russians from Brighton Beach like Ines Palek, who had come to watch the cloudbursts of fire rise from the Statue of Liberty, an even greater icon. Ines had not heard of Mayakovsky, however, unlike her boyfriend Juan Hern\u00e1ndez from Honduras, who greatly admired his work, and for that reason chose to be among those above the flowing river that winds around the capital of the capitalist century. It had been a night of nerves and celebration, entwined. The arrest of an alleged revolutionary Islamic terrorist in Seattle had caused the global city-state's celebrations to be cancelled, and in Brooklyn a man had been arrested and charged in association with the case. FBI investigations into Ahmed Ressan's background had produced a scary picture of a radical Muslim network ready to strike on Millennium Eve. In New York, 8,000 police officers were combing the crowds, warned by the FBI and President Clinton that their safety was not guaranteed. But the hour, and the year, came and went. Likewise at the headquarters of the Federal Aviation Authority in Herndon, Virginia, focus of concerns about the Y2K digital armageddon. 'Apocalypse Not', was how the FAA's spokesman put it, standing in front of a map showing the 5,600 flights that had taken off from US airports in the 35 minutes since midnight. There will be no relaxation, however, until 6 January, until the possible 'degenerations' had been checked. And so midnight crept across America like a plague in a Stephen King story, engulfing one firework-crowned skyline after another: Chicago, Dallas, and finally the vibrant sprawl dubiously billed as the Pacific capital of the next century, Los Angeles, the crystal city. Nick Anduze, British-born manager of the pink Cadillac Hotel on Venice Beach, described a convergence of those who are said to assemble at that edge of America where the loose bolts gather, not properly secured elsewhere. The morning after produced some debate on mass television about what the next 1,000 years have in store. CNN had spent the night telling the United States (in its first millennium) about how Egypt was celebrating its seventh. Then Faith Popcorn came on. 'We will not know the difference between what is virtual and what is real,' the 'futurist' said. Her adversary, Walt Wacker, also dubbed futurist, disagreed. 'We are ushering in the epic of uncertainty,' he assured - as the anchor quickly moved on to the next item.

The 150 middle-aged Italians and French who had jetted in on a last-minute package tour were as glum as leftover Christmas puddings. Here they were at the end of the mapped universe with a Malian dressed like a Kosovan refugee singing in a language they did not understand about a country of which they knew nothing with musicians who smoked continuously and sat on the floor... Twenty minutes later, the band were looking desperate. 'Are you 'appeee?' shouted one of the backing singers. The audience remained as impassive as judges at a British horse show. The singer tried again. 'Are you appee? Etes-vous contents?' The 60 or so Malians who by now had infiltrated the room were swaying, but the great rump of middle Euroland was still not impressed. It was all too much for one elderly French couple who got up and left, saying they thought the music was too loud. Then a girl in a red dress began to dance with the band. The Malians began to bop. Others, emboldened, started to shout at the Euroblobs to get up or get out. They finally got the message and most filtered into the night. In a few minutes the room had been taken over by the Malians and the new year was greeted with an ecstasy of arm-wavings, tears of joy and Bonnes Ann\u00e9es. Mali, as always, had retained its dignity, but it was a close shave. The band leader was Ali Farka Tour\u00e9, Mali's most celebrated musician, a man who packs giant dance halls in the US, France and Britain. 'I have come back to my land for the year 2000. Once I went to the people around the world. Now they can come and see me.' Tour\u00e9 was everywhere on Friday night; in the desert playing to a crowd as the sun set, in the hotels, and then at dawn back in the desert, ripped but still fervently hoping the millennium would turn round the fortunes of his country. How many people will trek to Timbuktu to see him or the narrow sandy streets of the city built 1,000 years ago, which reached its apogee as a centre of world learning and religion before the British empire was even conceived, remains unclear. Poor Mali. Poor Timbuktu. So far from anywhere, so beautiful, but so unappreciated. Last year fewer than 50,000 tourists came, and the landlocked country remains one of the three poorest in the world. Most people earn less than a dollar a day. The mayor, who likes to personally stamp the passports of every visitor, had given up and closed shop. The three hotel keepers were booked out, tents were being set up in the desert outside town, a new hotel had opened in record time and people were throwing open their doors to the estimated 350 foreigners in town. 'Tourism may be the only way to survive,' said Jiddou ag Almoustapha, president of the the town's Tuareg association. Many of these nomads still refuse to settle or to do manual work, but hiring out camels, selling cheap knives and singing for tourists is one of the few options they now have for survival. They recognise that there is good money to be mined from the whites just as salt has for centuries been mined from the desert. For the vast majority of Timbuktu's citizens, millennium night was as any other, with no clocks sounding, bells or fireworks at midnight. The streets were quiet and black. This is Ramadan and the pressure from mosques and Koranic schools to be indoors with the family has been great."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk7", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:23Z", "webTitle": "Putting on the Blitz\u0085", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk7", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk7", "fields": {"bodyText": "The gala opening of the Millennium Dome was advertised in the promotional literature that arrived with my ticket as 'one amazing night'. And so it was, though not perhaps in the way anticipated by the spin doctors of the New Millennium Experience Company. For many of the 10,000 'ordinary people' (raffle-winners, zone-sponsor employees, New Labour stooges, mediacrats) who had submitted their personal details to the 'stringent security measures' we heard so much about as we lined up at Stratford tube, the Party of the Millennium was preceded by the Queue of the Apocalypse. As a party venue for 10,000, the Dome has a number of disadvantages. You cannot drive to it. It's in the middle of nowhere. It's as intimate as a diner-a-deux at Wembley Stadium (actually, it's two or three times the size). And in winter, it's freezing cold. The Dome is barely a bomb's throw from the East End that was flattened by the Luftwaffe, and on millennium night it was the spirit of the Blitz that got us all through. 'Let's all start singing \"Why Are We Waiting\",' said the woman behind me after two or three aeons of futile queueing. 'Well, I really do hope it's going to be worth the wait,' observed another, sourly. Pity the poor old Dome. It has, like the Government that ordered it into being, been abused, patronised, sneered at, and disparaged by the standing army of British bien pensants. From afar, and from the outside, it is a surprisingly British structure, not elegant or uplifting, but not unimpressive either. At night, it looks like a kind of intergalactic son et lumi\u00e8re, certainly not the Bilbao Guggenheim nor the Pompidou Centre, nor the renovated Reichstag, but with a comfortingly homemade British feel to it. I suspect that quite a few of the 10,000 who eventually filtered into the dark, draughty vastness of this cathedral of materialism for the first time were secretly proud of the place. Add to this the thought that, three years ago, when the incoming New Labour administration gave the project the green light, many people doubted that it could be completed on time (or on budget), and you have a typically British success-story: a compromise snatched from the jaws of indifference. Like it or loathe it, the Dome perfectly reflects our society. The party itself, 'one amazing night', also turned out to be as British as the Blitz. Packaged airline canapes and screw-top airline champagne were distributed, from 'hospitality points' to the guests as they made their way into the central arena. There was a scattering of celebrities, actors, historians, radio reporters, Cabinet Ministers and newspaper editors. Andrew Motion, the Poet Laureate, was there. So was Salman Rushdie, with Martin Amis. Among the many television executives scurrying about with mobile phones, the outgoing Director-General of the BBC, John Birt, rubbed shoulders with his successor, Greg Dyke. The presence of TV people was apt. The millennium show was Channel 5 meets BBC2. It was partly London Palladium (Stephen Fry), partly Butlins (Jools Holland and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra), and partly the Last Night of the Proms (Holst's Planets and massed millennium choirs). It was blander and more stage managed than a lifetime subscription to New Labour. It had everything a Millbank spin-doctor could wish for, even a gay choir. There was something English (Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra), something Welsh ('Cymru Fach') something old ('Amazing Grace') and something fairly new ('All You Need Is Love'). There was Handel's Let the Bright Seraphim, beautifully performed by Rosemary Joshua, and John Tavener's A New Beginning, brilliantly sung by David Wigram and Sumudu Jayatilaka. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, recited 'The Lord's Prayer', flanked by teenagers of different ethnic persuasions. As the new millennium dawned, Big Ben bonged the 10,000 into the New Era. The Queen joined in 'Auld Lang Syne' and (almost) linked hands with the Prime Minister. The organisers let off a lot of fireworks, and then the hordes of Peter Gabriel's Millennium Show swept across the central arena in a swirl of silks and banners. There is, I happen to know, a carefully worked out narrative to this show, but to the great majority of the 10,000 it was probably just an awesome display of aerial acrobatics and gymno-balletic synchronised movement. After this display of multi-cultural diversity, the national agenda reasserted itself and the 10,000, now acting as one, sang 'God Save The Queen'. Then the object of this homage gave quite a jolly millennial wave and the royal party left the party. After that the 10,000 hurried for the Stratford tube. If they got home before daybreak there'd be a good chance they could enjoy the whole event on television."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk10", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:23Z", "webTitle": "The Rollers, the ravers and the smell of fried onions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk10", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk10", "fields": {"bodyText": "Edinburgh's Millennium Hogmanay ended in a capital hangover after a week of well-lubricated celebrations culminated in a four-minute display of pyrotechnics launched on the stroke of midnight. Tens of thousands of revellers gathered for what was billed as the biggest street party in the world. No one without a pass was allowed beyond checkpoints which sealed off the city centre. Glass bottles were forbidden and parents were advised to leave children at home. The night was mild, if drizzly. Castle Rock was floodlit and booths selling venison burgers, daft hats and commemorative T-shirts turned the Royal Mile into a medieval fair. Kilts with outrageous sporrans and 'See You Jimmy' hats were de rigueur and buskers grabbed prime pitches early. All over the city serried ranks of Portaloos waited to cope with the unprecedented demand. The organisers left nothing to chance, even printing the words of 'Auld Lang Syne' on the back of the guide to the festivities. What the countless foreign visitors made of lines like 'We twa hae run about the braes, And pou'd the gowans fine' is hard to imagine. Not that it mattered. The emphasis was on having a good time, and the police and stewards seemed determined to play their part, posing for photographs with inebriated young girls who had long lost their inhibitions. Throughout the night bands played on several stages. Outside St Giles' Cathedral, where the Calvinist preacher John Knox denounced Mary, Queen of Scots, and spoke of the 'monstrous regiment of women', you could hear Deaf Shepherd and the Red Hot Ceilidh Peppers. In Princes Street Gardens were the Bay City Rollers, Del Amitri and the Mavericks. Up at the Castle, Texas kicked up a storm. Elsewhere there were electric bagpipes, Los Jovenes Classicos del Son, a Cuban band, Salsa Celtica ('Edinburgh's Latin sensations') and the Notting Hill Carnival Roadshow. This is now what comprises a 'traditional' Scottish New Year. For those seeking a whiff of authenticity, there was a replica of a Highland cottage which you could look inside to see a typical Scottish family celebrating Hogmanay. As Princes Street filled, the crowds jostled for prime spots, swigging from plastic bottles, jigging to ghetto blasters and blowing trumpets in the night air, which had become perfumed with the smell of fried onions and mustard. As the apocalyptic hour drew near, pubs, restaurants and hotels emptied and the crowds spilled into the streets for the fireworks. The rain stopped and a solitary star winked in an inky sky. For a moment, the world seemed to hold its breath, suspended between millennia. Then there erupted a cocktail of fireworks, a sparkling symphony of colour, lighting up the night sky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk6", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:23Z", "webTitle": "Hoaxes can't dampen mood Blair 'just wants to bottle'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk6", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk6", "fields": {"bodyText": "Millennium organisers claim to have pulled off the biggest celebration in Britain since the end of the war after around 2.6 million revellers poured on to the streets of London and millions more celebrated around Britain. Tony Blair described the festive atmosphere as so good that 'you just want to bottle it and keep it'. But as Britain woke up to a collective hangover, questions were being asked about chaotic transport and crowd management which left one dead and thousands frustrated. Families who had travelled from all over Britain for the opening night of the Millennium Dome at Greenwich, southeast London, were held up for as much as four hours at Underground stations. At Stratford, in East London, almost 5,000 guests had to pass through a single security scanner, causing a long delay. There was a hint from government yesterday that a bomb hoax was partly to blame. Home Secretary Jack Straw revealed in a congratulatory letter to the head of the Metropolitian police, Sir Paul Condon that there had been \"a series of bomb threats\" on millennium night and the days leading up to it. Sources said that one threat was at the Dome itself on Millennium night, though Blair was kept in the dark about it until yesterday. The north bank of the Thames around Big Ben had to be closed off for three hours because of the size of the crowd. Last night the Port of London Authority admitted that one man was missing after falling or jumping off Lambeth Bridge. A spokesman for the authority said last night: 'We are unlikely to recover him for some time. In such cases it usually takes 10 days for the river to return the body.' There were at least another four 'jumpers' during the celebrations. Three were pulled from the water and a fourth swam to shore, where he evaded the police by running into the crowd. But fears of a one-night crime wave proved to be unfounded. Crime was down 5 per cent on the previous New Year's Eve. There were only 99 arrests in central London. Along the Thames, 37 tons of explosives were safely detonated in Britain's biggest firework display. At about 3am yesterday Tony Blair and the Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, visited London Bridge fire station to praise the emergency services. In the morning Blair emerged from Downing Street to watch 12,000 marchers parade past a crowd of 1m through Whitehall and talk to members of the public. He told them: 'There was a fantastic atmosphere everywhere you went. You can still feel that this morning. 'I have always been confident the Dome would be a success and last night really was breathtaking. I really do recommend you go and have a look. 'It lived up to its billing and the fantastic thing is that millennium celebrations in this country go on for a year and not just today. 'The easy thing to do would have been to scrap it [the Dome] when we came to power, but I really felt that would be a terrible missed opportunity. Greenwich Mean Time is known throughout the world as the home of time, so I really felt it was important to do something special and, believe me, if you go there it really is. 'It is going to be great for tourism, jobs and help show Britain as a country confident about the future. 'What struck me both last night and again today is this real sense of confidence and optimism. You just want to bottle it and keep it.' But not everyone was so happy. Fred Cutler from Plymouth waited more than four hours at a Tube station. Once in the Dome he said: 'This was the most disappointing night of my life. We have worked for years for a children's family charity, which is why we are here tonight, but what they don't realise is that we have given up a millennium night with our families, children and loved ones to be stuck in a queue for four hours and then told that we could not have a drink.' Dome organiser Jennie Page promised an investigation, but insisted the evening had been a success. She said: 'Yes, of course, I was getting information about the problems all through the night and various calls were made. We will analyse it all later today, but even for those people who were delayed they said they felt it was a fantastic success when they got there.' She said her team decided to continue serving food and drink after the show and to stay open until 4am - two hours longer than planned - because people had missed part of the evening. Michael Grade, the Chairman of the Creative Review Group for the Dome, also played down the problem. He said: 'This was a one off and we did get 12,500 people in and out of here safely. It was not something that you could rehearse. There is no comparative event.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk5", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:23Z", "webTitle": "With nod to past Ulster steps into the future", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk5", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk5", "fields": {"bodyText": "It was a poignant place to mark the beginning of a new century for Northern Ireland. Twenty-eight years before, almost exactly on the spot where Abba tribute band Bj\u00f6rn Again entertained revellers on millennium eve, an IRA bomb killed six people. The bomb was one of 22 placed around Belfast that killed nine people on what became known as Bloody Friday. It was one of the most notorious atrocities in three decades of violence. Yet many of the tens of thousands who came down to Belfast's Waterfront to watch a spectacular firework display over the River Lagan seemed unaware of the historical significance of the location of their riverside party. The site of the Oxford Street bus bomb has been transformed into an open plaza overlooking Waterfront Hall - the flying saucer-shaped glass building where U2's Bono held the hands of David Trimble and John Hume aloft at a concert to support the Good Friday Agreement two years ago. Darragh O'Kane, 17, was surprised to learn that the square where he was standing had once been a scene of carnage. 'It's terrible to think what went on here in the Seventies but I wasn't even born. I just hope things like that never happen again.' His friend, Dermot O'Rawe, 17, said he had heard about Bloody Friday but had not known where it took place. 'It's weird to think one of the bombs went off here where all these people are now having a party,' he said. There was, however, a reminder of more recent terrorist atrocities close by along the edge of the Lagan Weir, where Belfast's millennium beacon was to be lit. Two teenagers from Omagh, the Co Tyrone town devastated by a Real IRA bomb in August 1998, were chosen to light the beacon. Twenty-nine people were killed in the Omagh explosion. Brendan Grimes, 15, was related to several victims. His grandmother Mary, 65, aunt Avril Monaghan, 30, her baby daughter, Maura, and her unborn twins died in the atrocity. Brendan was joined at the beacon by Leanne Martin, 15, who witnessed the massacre. Just after the ceremony a television reporter tried to prompt Brendan into giving the world his personal hopes for the new century. He wanted only 'peace at home and an end to Third World debt'. It was one of the most sincere and profound sentiments expressed in a night of soundbites. The beacon itself was a symbol of the problems that still beset the peace process. The organisers had planned to construct the iron torch out of decommissioned terrorist weapons. Gareth Corbett, a spokesman for the project, said they wanted to use about 10kg of melted-down guns on the top of the beacon. But their plan was thwarted by the absence of IRA, UVF and UDA disarmament, an absence that could still derail the new power-sharing executive at Stormont within the next few months. Other revellers recognised the importance of Belfast's celebration in the light of 30 years of conflict. Standing at Belfast's City Hall, Father John Friel, said: 'I am thrilled to be part of these celebrations. It's something that unites all of us. There is a real feeling of goodwill and I think it's essential that we build on this expression of unity in the days that lie ahead. I hope that some of the euphoria that we are experiencing will be translated into political and economic beginnings.' Close to 100,000 people flocked into the city centre for the millennium party. The last time such numbers came on to the streets was in 1986 when hundreds of thousands of loyalists marched in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement. This time the atmosphere was transformed, with virtually no sectarian chanting or violence. An RUC spokesman said there were six arrests, mainly related to drunkenness. 'Millennium eve was actually quieter in terms of violence on the streets than a normal Friday night,' he said. However, one man died after an attack in Antrim town, about 20 miles outside Belfast. He was found with head injuries at around 4.50am on the loyalist Stiles estate. A police spokesman stressed that they were keeping on open mind on the motive for the killing. The spirit of unity extended to Derry, where the troubles began in 1969. Hundreds marched around the city's seventeenth-century walls in a torchlit procession. The walls were part of the Protestant citadel that held out against James II's army in 1689 and were still a focal point for sectarian division three hundred years later over loyalist marches to commemorate the siege. But on millennium eve there was no re-routing of the marchers as Derry's celebrations were beamed to three continents for the Irish diaspora. Orangemen playing drums and nationalists playing the traditional bodhran united together in a group called Different Drums. John Hume - one of the chief architects of the peace process - joined in the singing of 'Danny Boy', an anthem shared by both communities. Across the River Foyle at Altnagelvin hospital a sordid auction broke out between rival British tabloids attempting to buy pictures of Northern Ireland's first millennium baby. Local photographers, many of whom have covered the Troubles for 30 years, were turned away from the maternity ward as bidders from the People and News of the World waved cheque books in the face of a family from Newtonstewart, Co Tyrone. In the early hours of yesterday morning the People appeared to have won the race with an offer, it is understood, of around \u00a332,000. By lunchtime however the News of the World had upped the stakes to \u00a340,000. A sign of the shape of things to come perhaps in a new peaceful, prosperous Northern Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk9", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:23Z", "webTitle": "Club Mersey parties the long night away", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk9", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk9", "fields": {"bodyText": "The customary chill of the Liverpool docks was transformed to a warm ebullience, as 250,000 revellers greeted the new millennium with the help of Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr and 26,000 clubbers within the Space Roof Arena, the closest the North-West has come to mimicking the magnificence of the Millennium Dome. McCartney's pre-recorded message of goodwill and peace was broadcast to a crowd of 15,000 on St George's Plateau, while the Space Roof Arena at Pier Head, just across from the Albert Docks, played host to DJs Norman Cook (alias Fatboy Slim), Orbital and Paul Oakenfold over a 14-hour marathon costing \u00a375 a head. The night reached the first of several sweaty climaxes when the Bishop of Liverpool, the Rt Rev James Jones, having addressed a congregation of 2,000 in Liverpool Cathedral as the clock struck midnight, took to the dance floor. The festivities officially began at 6pm when the mayor lit the city's millennium beacon. Many of the pubs closed at 7pm, despite charging \u00a32.85 a pint, plus an entry fee. This came as something of an inconvenience to Sue and Cheryl, two 20-year-old students. They had expected to spend the night with friends, touring the bars, but instead they had to go to a nearby party to kill time. At the Metropolitan Cathedral, on Brownlow Hill, 3,000 young people stayed up all night as testament to their faith. The restored bells of the Municipal Buildings, in Dale Street, rang for the first time since the Second World War. On St George's Plateau, the Liverpool bands Echo and the Bunnymen and the Christians entertained the crowds. But the city was surprisingly in the thrall of the official party at the Cream 2000 club venue. Midnight was marked by the club's huge television screens counting down the seconds as theatrically as possible. A flurry of mock cowboy hats and torn T-shirts defined the crowd. By 2am, the venue was mildly hysterical. The majority of the party-goers had come from elsewhere in the country, to make the most of the extravagant preparations Liverpool had put together. Gary, from Romford, Essex, had met his friends at London's Euston Station at 11am and begun celebrating immediately. They started the party on the train to Liverpool, and headed straight for Cream at 5pm, so as not to miss a moment of the 'top night' they had paid for. The outing cost him \u00a3125 before 'extras', nearly a week's wages. The night's biggest disappointment was the absence of DJ Carl Cox, who was playing in London and going on to Hawaii, but Gary said it was a great excuse for an outrageous night out. By 5am, the crowd had begun to dissipate, leaving behind beer cans and water bottles an inch deep, when Norman Cook, veteran of a long night's DJ-ing in London, Cardiff and finally Liverpool, took the stage. At 8am, the venue closed. While London excited itself about the significance of this date, Liverpool seemed to find its high in insouciance and irreverence. As Cream finally emptied out, the conventionality of the night became apparent, as one face-painted clubber turned to another and said: 'See you next time.'

No Queen, no Prime Minister Superstar, no suits, no Janus-faces jostling for power and position, only a press of ordinary Londoners relishing and fearing the bitter-sweet cut of time - of where were you? Licensed madness was in the air. A woman in a nightie had her picture taken cuddling a policeman in his dayglo livery. A clamper lorry seeped by, attracting a vortex of boos, until someone brave enough went over and kissed the driver. How much are you being paid? 'Thirty pounds an hour,' said the poor wretch, 'and it's not enough.' Everyone started loving him. Time accelerated and, with a great orgasmic shout, the crowd roared out that the M-spot had been hit and the two hands of Big Ben were as one. A black guy fizzed up his bottle of champagne and sprayed his kids, his wife, the party of Spaniards squashed against the bridge balustrade, the Kiwi opera singer, the former Page Three star - was it Jilly Johnson? Gosh! - the beautiful French woman, the GMTV presenter, the spectacularly crude Australian, the senior press officer for the Department of Health and the psycho-neurotic drunk who kept on chewing broken glass bottles - ordinary Londoners every one - and the fireworks began. Guy Fawkes would have loved them. At one moment Big Ben disappeared in a cloud of red fire, and one saw London as it must have been during the Blitz, buildings emerging from flickering flames. The smoke, the repeated booms, punched away at the senses like heavy artillery having a good time. The final flourish was the blue stars dropping down from a Blair heaven: subliminal Europhilia? Or pretty blue stars? No one cared. It was a brilliant moment to be alive, and in the world's most exciting city. Opera singer Paul Whelan sang 'Auld Lang Syne' in a fine baritone, but with so many complete strangers - especially the psychopath - the critical mass of hand-wringing did not take off. GMTV reporter Penny Smith and the vulgar Australian competed for the perfect metaphor. Penny: 'The earth definitely moved \u0085 even if the River of Fire didn't show me just how fast it was moving.' The Ozzie replied: 'The millennium? Like sex for an Australian, it was over in a second.' He then started filling my plastic cup with Sauterne, which was totally disgusting. But what about the cock-ups? The River of Fire? Impossible to see from where I was in the sardine tin. The Dons were closest to the Thames. Was the River of Fire any good? 'Que?' asked a Spaniard. Speaking my best Basil Fawlty Spanish, I bawled: 'Rivieria del fuelgo?' 'Que?' 'Donda est rivieriar \u0085 sorry \u0085 rio del fuego?' 'Que?' This went on for about half an hour and eventually it came out that he hadn't seen it. The unmoving Eye? Blame the French. It was their pods that buggered up. I launched into an Edward Heath-style interrogation of the beautiful Frenchwoman, who treated me with Gallic disdain, before declaring: 'Zee wheel was bughreded oop on porpoise.' Later inquiries have shown that the offending piece of machinery was a clutch, one made in Germany. Sounds like a case for Biggles, if you ask me. Then the police started shooing us off the bridge with a sweet patience which was rewarded, too often, with moronic abuse. The psychopath gobbled up the last of his bottle. One should not play down the bitter-sweetness of it all. Some loved ones were missing at that cruel knife-slash of time; one woman close by the James Bond building, the headquarters of MI6 at Vauxhall Cross, sobbed uncontrollably into a mobile phone. Children looked, more often than not, scared rather than happy. One poor soul leapt off Lambeth Bridge at some point in the night, and is still missing. Others had little time to celebrate and were getting on with the job of making London tick. Like the police. Like the health workers. Like the public transport workers. The noble sadness of not being in the right place at the right time when God - or whoever - wound our sundials into the third millennium was most beautifully expressed for ordinary people by a Tube driver on the Bakerloo Line, running from Oxford Circus to Lambeth North on millennium night. 'When I was seven or eight I remember looking forward to the millennium and thinking how far away it was and here it is tonight. I wanted to be a pilot. I ended up as a Tube driver. But it's a good job. And London Underground's a good company to work for. Even if I never did make it as a pilot. More a submarine pilot.

Extra volunteers are on call to listen to those who have found themselves unable to cope with the celebration imperative. 'We will get a lot of calls from people who have had huge expectations of having the night of their life and they won't have done,' said Alison Weisselberg, the national co-ordinator for youth and a volunteer working on New Year's Eve. 'They'll have had a row or broken up - all those things that happen at these crucial times. A lot of young people will be affected by that. The expectations have been greater than usual because of the millennium. The despair afterwards, when people realise their problems have not gone away, will be greater.' A mobile Samaritan unit offered help to all comers throughout Millennium Eve, from police officers seeking paracetamol to young people mourning lost loves. During the worst of the crush the Samaritans unit also fielded inquiries for practical help to those seeking first-aid centres or means of taking their young child-ren away from the crowds. 'There was never a moment without a caller,' said Lois, a volunteer. 'Some had histories of mental ill-health, others needed to know they were not alone. 'But we will be even busier over the weekend and tomorrow when people wake up realising they have to go back to work and that it hasn't really been a great, new dawn.' The Samaritans expect people to divide into two groups: those now so relieved to have survived all their millennium fears intact that they are enjoying a kind of euphoria, and those - mostly young - who expected wonderful things and are now disillusioned. Their millennial hangovers may be profound and lasting. Early estimates suggest calls will be above average throughout January, which is already - according to recent records - the month with the highest suicide rate. For many the hangovers are more literal. This year St Thomas's, directly across the Thames from Westminster and at the centre of the London celebrations, saw a stream of revellers who were suffering alcohol-related injuries. On Millennial Eve it dealt with three times as many patients as the previous new year, dealing with many in an alcohol recovery area nicknamed the 'vomitarium' and staffed by 15 volunteers. From midnight onwards it was standing room only in the accident and emergency unit. The story was much the same in hospitals around the country, where waiting times in already overstretched casualty units reached 10 hours. Trent ambulance service reported its busiest night since records began, while London Ambulance Service responded to 2,500 calls. At St Thomas's, London, Steve from Acton, supported by his friend, defiantly limped off to take a champagne break from queuing, returning crestfallen after Steve fell over and saw his precious bottle explode on the tarmac. Between midnight and 8am St Thomas's A&amp;E had seen 300 patients. The 21 nurses and nine doctors worked under intense pressure and for far longer than their usual 10-hour shifts. One doctor who had arrived at 2pm on New Year's Eve was hoping to leave by 9pm on New Year's Day. As with the rest of the country, the single biggest reason for the admissions had been alcohol. Next came drug-related collapses, with panic attacks a close third as London's streets reached sardine-can conditions. Two people survived falls into the Thames but there were three heart attack deaths after midnight. Those who were treated at St Thomas's had first to pass through tight security. Two burly security men vetted entrants at the doors of A&amp;E before being allowed to join a queue to be assessed. Only then were they allowed to join the oddly silent throng in the waiting room. 'It has been a night from hell,' said one nurse. 'Drunks are always a major problem,but I have never seen so many drink and drug cases. If one more drunk says \"Happy New Year\" I might hit them. 'We're getting an extra \u00a3150 for this, and it doesn't seem worth it just at the minute. Ask me again when my shift finishes at 7.30.' Outside on the forecourt weary ambulance crews sluiced vomit from the floors of their vehicles before driving off across bottles and cans to the next call.

In Sydney, first off the starting blocks, the harbour was a mirror to a stunning display of fireworks from the bridge, with the wonky origami of the Opera House in the foreground. Beijing put out tyrannical pomp, but the firework makers have an edge Western manufacturers lack: there are next to zero restrictions on the amount of explosives they can use, so the sky above the Forbidden City was rent with bangs that you normally see in war zones. India and the Middle East both tried hard, but they were not truly in the millennial swim of things so that the next serious competitor became Paris. Designed by Yves Pepin, scimitars of fire shot out from all the elevations of the Eiffel Tower. Down the Champs Elys\u00e9es, 11 ferris wheels glimmered with fire, and they went round - unlike the London Eye which moved, but so imperceptibly that no one noticed on the big night. But it was the use of Paris's most famous landmark as a launch-pad for the celebrations, bathing the City of Lights as if in sunlight, which made the French capital deliver what was perhaps the world's most spectacular show. In France, fireworks - feux d'artifice - are seen as an art form in itself, but then so are cartoons. In London, river barges were the platforms for cascades of fireworks, which bounced off the low cloud and the River Thames, making the city and the river swim with colour from Greenwich to Vauxhall in the most impressive display of pyrotechnics the city has seen since the visits by Hitler's Luftwaffe. The man responsible was also the genius behind Sydney's display. Robert McDermott, 32, used 40 tonnes of explosives on 16 barges to light up London. The oohs and ahhs of the crowd after the 16-minute firework display more than made up for the disappointment over the River of Fire, which went off without a hitch, according to the organisers, but was invisible to the human eye. Perhaps the aliens enjoyed it. But the most unexpected fireworks came from the land of surprises, Russia. For a brief flicker of horror on Millennium Night, the American Dr Strangeloves deep in a bunker underneath the Rockies at NORAD watched three trajectories curve into the sky. A nuclear strike triggered by the millennium bug? Then the three curves started to descend. They were Scuds, destined for Grozny. The head of Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces was true to his word, that the only missiles he expected to be launched into the sky were the fireworks he would shoot off in his back garden with his children. And for that limited display, we must give thanks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "politics/2000/jan/02/tonyblair.uk", "type": "article", "sectionId": "politics", "sectionName": "Politics", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:24Z", "webTitle": "Mrs Blair's Diary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/02/tonyblair.uk", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/02/tonyblair.uk", "fields": {"bodyText": "Monday: I was so looking forward to today, in a way. One of our few chances to pretend we were just a normal family, doing those things that normal families do, pigging out on leftover turkey sandwiches with lashings of mayo and watching telly together. I hadn't realised, of course, quite what people - normal people, civilians - have to go through. First stop was the local corner-shop - well, only half a mile away - where I tried to buy some white bread, the last of the ciabatta having run out after Prescott so amusingly stuck it down his crotch during charades last Thursday. The shopkeeper just laughed - 'Bread? You'll be lucky! It's Christmas, innit?' - and tried to sell me some drugs and something called Carlsberg Special Brew. Back, wearily disconsolate, to spend six hours trying to find something we could watch together. Fantastic choice. BBC2 and ITV had horse-racing on all day. Channel 4 had an eight-hour opera about Icelandic ring-torque lathes. Mimed. BBC1 had Carry on Being Crap (1972), with guest appearances by Gareth Hunt, Noddy Holder, Terry Tripe, Patrick Past-It, Dame Angela Talentless and Miss Nookie Flirt, followed by an episode of The Funny Family in which they laugh for two hours at the dog farting. Still, I suppose I'm glad to see what everyone else has to go through, albeit for one day a year. So glad. Yes. Glad we stayed at home for once, and didn't have to race off to the Seychelles or anything. Hmph. Lying on the beach at La Digue again \u0085 well, who needs it? Sheesh. Pftui. Tuesday: Up to Trimdon to meet sweet, normal people, refreshingly. In the rain. And hear them talk about how crap the Christmas telly was. And ask Tony if he'd ever met Gareth Hunt. And pat my stomach. And breathe on me, and drip on me from their anoraks. Thinking, for some unaccountable reason, of that particular palm tree at La Digue, the big frondy one, with the view, and the bar 10 steps away that was saving that rather fine bottle of Montrachet '78. Wednesday: Quite how unlucky can the Boy Hague be? Clarke attacks Hague. Major attacks Hague. World's last dodo egg miraculously found; chick emerges from egg and attacks Hague. Christ rises for millennium; attacks Hague. What next \u0085 spontaneous human combustion? Thursday: Tony has insisted on doing another of his speeches about beacons. Much talk of how great it is for a such a small country to produce so many great actors, singers, etc, which was a point he wanted to ram home with today's honours for 'icons', but that Y2K bug must have hit rather early and messed up the whole list; the only names I recognised were those of Gareth Hunt, Noddy Holder, Terry Tripe, Patrick Past-It, Dame Angela Talentless and Miss Nookie Flirt, plus a lifetime's achievement award for Mr Sean Wifebeater. Friday: Finally, the big day dawns, or rather sunsets. Tony had tried, politely but in vain, to get out of opening the London Eye, it having that garlicky whiff of failure about it, but eventually said a few words ('Right. It's open.') and we raced off to the dome. Not sure what all the transport fuss was about tonight; it took us a matter of minutes to scoot out to Greenwhich, the only hold-ups being lots of silly people in frocks and dinner-suits who spilled out of the Tube station at Stratford blocking the road. Anyway, a lovely night; particularly the moving Tavener and the emotional Beatles bit, which Tony had to pretend not to know the words to, being next to Queenie, and the wonderful ballet stuff afterwards, and the particularly wonderful fact that the dome didn't blow up, and the even more wonderful knowledge that it was actually finished in time, and, most of all, the wonderful, wonderful realisation that we can now stop worrying about the damn thing and get on with \u0085 with whatever it is we're doing.

'The Dome is breathtaking. I feel like Alice in Wonderland,' said Mrs Covell, who was accompanied by her son Paul, 60, from Amersham, Bucks and grandson Mark, 32, from Rothwell, Leeds. Other enthusiastic visitors included telecommunications project manager John Lawless, 34, from Southwater, Horsham, West Sussex. 'This has been good value for money and I think it's wonderful,' said Mr Lawless, who was accompanied by his wife Elaine, 34, and son Stuart, four. The Nobles, from Stamford, Lincolnshire, said they were surprised how spacious the Dome was. Jill Noble, a company consultant said she thought it had been designed to entertain people between the ages of eight and 18 primarily, but she did enjoy the BT Talk Zone. 'I though it was all really well organised.' Her daughters Claire,16, and Katy, 13, were also impressed, particularly enjoying the Play and Money zones. 'I don't think it is too commercial,' said Claire. 'I spent \u00a31 million in the Money zone but it was just fun.' The main attraction - the Body zone - is dominated by a giant sculpture of a male and a female in a gentle, reclining embrace. Visitors travel through the body, seeing a room which contains a giant heart whose beat rate increases at the sound of barking dogs . The zone also has a 'comedy brain' room in which a brain wearing a fez 'tells' Tommy Cooper jokes to other brains, which appear to laugh. Also popular was the Home Planet, where visitors are taken on a ride showing the wonders of the Earth, complete with both sound and heat effects. 'I was really burning up when we were shown pictures of that volcano,' said Tabitha Springham, five, from Wicken Bonhunt, Saffron Walden, Essex. After the opening celebration closed at 4am yesterday morning, Dome staff worked through the night to clear the site for the 12,000 visitors due to be let in at 11am. Dome Chief Executive Jennie Page returned to her hotel nearby for three hours rest before coming back to watch her first customers arrive. Michael Grade, chairman of the Dome's Creative Review Group, said: 'I do hope the accent is on fun, but not just for the sake of it. Even in the Play zone the activities are more than simply meaningless fun. That was always my nightmare - that it would all seem meaningless.' The Dome's customers were treated to the first public performance of the aerial millennium show - albeit one hour late due to technical problems. Rock concert producer Mark Fisher and Micha Bergese, the creators of the show, have put together a fable of modern mankind. Reminiscent of both the popular French Cirque de Soleil and Riverdance, the show enacts the fight to live in unison with both machinery and nature."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T00:50:24Z", "webTitle": "Mobs and nobs make a night to remember", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/millennium.uk1", "fields": {"bodyText": "The 50 police officers staffing Scotland Yard's high-tech Gold Control Room spent the millennium celebrations fighting a sombre battle to prevent the estimated three million people crowding central London streets from falling into the Thames or being crushed, Hillsborough-style. The event started off far more quietly than expected, with fewer than 25,000 people turning out by 6pm. But as the evening progressed that rapidly changed as hundreds of thousands of revellers poured out of Tube stations or walked along special clearways towards the major attractions. With more than 6,000 officers on duty and fewer arrests than during previous new year's celebrations, Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston declared the event a huge success. Many of the revellers themselves, however, had a different story to tell. Although record number of police were on the streets, the vast majority were employed guarding road blocks or Tube stations. The surging crowds were mostly left to their own devices. Offences that would normally have resulted in arrest or caution were left unpunished. Hundreds of people openly smoked cannabis, and some waved their spliffs defiantly at nearby police, knowing they could not be caught in the huge crowds. But the police crowd control techniques had their critics. Thousands experienced extended periods of terror and panic as huge swathes of people surged forward, threatening to trample others underneath. Some people became hysterical. 'It was very scary for about an hour after 9.30pm, when the crowds seemed to be piling up out of control,' said one Samaritan witness, on duty below Hungerford Bridge, on the Embankment. 'I really thought there would be trouble because I could not see any police or stewards. There were no signs telling people where anything was.' At 9.30pm the police warned over loudspeakers that the Embankment was full. Anyone wanting to see the fireworks was urged to go to Tower Bridge. The warnings fell on deaf ears, with more than 200,000 attempting to walk the wrong way. Police urged them to turn back and go along Whitehall, but within minutes, the crush in Whitehall had become dangerous, and the police were forced to open up Whitehall Place to let some people down to the river. They closed it again within 10 minutes because of serious overcrowding by the Thames. Towards Blackfriars bridge, there was a crush that provoked sporadic fights before hundreds of revellers climbed over fencing to reach the safety of the gardens of the Inner and Middle Temple lawyers' chambers. Police shut the bridge to traffic at 6.30pm - hours earlier than originally planned - because of the crowds. 'You couldn't see what was happening. You couldn't move. Every now and then the crowd would surge one way or another, and I was terrified that I was going to fall over,' said Vicky Mitchell, a singer from Chelmsford. 'The police just seemed to be intent on keeping out of everyone's way.' At one point the police had to surround the Port of London Authority command headquarters, near Tower Bridge, to protect staff from the crowds. A PLA spokesman said: 'It looked like a riot was going off at one point.' Shortly before midnight, the police urged people to leave the Thames foreshore at Lambeth and Waterloo, fearing hundreds might end up in the river. The worst problems came at the end of the firework display. Around the South Bank as party-goers tried to make their way towards Waterloo station at 12.30am, many found themselves unable to move for more than an hour due to the sheer weight of numbers. Hundreds of families and babies in pushchairs were caught. Outside London, a large presence of families and a softy-softly policing style ensured few arrests. Only 200 were made in the whole of Wales, significantly fewer than in previous years. Police in Greater Manchester arrested about 100 people - a typical figure for any Friday night. There were just 24 arrests in Edinburgh, and 48 in the Strathclyde region, covering Glasgow. Assistant Commissioner Ian Johnston of the Metropolitan police claimed the capital's low arrest figures were proof that the Met's approach had been correct. Despite evidence of illegal drug use on a wide scale, only three arrests were made in London for drugs offences. There were 99 arrests in total, 5 per cent fewer than last year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "theguardian/2000/jan/02/guardianletters", "type": "article", "sectionId": "theguardian", "sectionName": "From the Guardian", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T01:07:00Z", "webTitle": "Back to the future", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jan/02/guardianletters", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/jan/02/guardianletters", "fields": {"bodyText": "Stefan Collini's reference to Felix Holt (The end of the world as we know it, Saturday Review, January 1) prompts me to write to you about the 'pneumatic railway' at Crystal Palace.

It appears to have been fast and efficient, although it ran for only a few hundred yards. I can well believe she enthused about it as the 'transport of the future.' In fact nothing ever came of it. The Crystal Palace line was quite different from the attempts in the 1840s to use atmospheric traction at Croydon and in south Devon. On these earlier railways, trains were propelled by pistons in atmospheric tubes laid between the rails. At Crystal Palace, the whole carriage was enclosed in an atmospheric tunnel. It was indeed the 'cross between the Chunnel and and air- rifle' that Collini imagines.

'It was a crazy time in New York, right before the Reagan years, like the last days of old Rome, people were just out there. There was no such thing as Aids, and in certain circles people were saying cocaine was not addictive.' In the simmering heat, a city-wide blackout led to outbreaks of mass looting. Disco was reaching its height and punk had emerged from the underground. And somewhere on the edge of the madness was 20-year-old college student Shelton Lee, back home for the summer. 'I was an observer. To this day I have never done drugs. And I was nobody, nor did I have the money to get into Studio 54, and there was no way I was getting into [legendary orgy club] Plato's Retreat! I was still trying to get a girl to go with me to the movies, let alone a sex club.' He's laughing. 'First things first!' Instead, Lee wandered the city with a super-8 camera. 'I wasn't thinking \"I'm going to teach myself film-making\", I just picked up a camera and was shooting stuff. I didn't know what it was going to lead to when I was doing it.' That first experience of film-making distantly inspired Lee's new film, Summer Of Sam, set in 1977. 'My memories are a lot of what's in the film.' But not the footage. 'I can't find it. I have it somewhere but I can't find it.' The story starts with the panic created by a serial murderer, known as the .44-killer and later the Son of Sam, who was terrorising the Italian-American community. 'It was a very exciting time but it was also very scary. Son of Sam altered the way people lived their lives. You couldn't hang out, you couldn't sit in parked cars. People stayed shut in behind closed doors.' It is the effects of David Berkowitz's spree, rather than the killer himself, that Lee and scriptwriter/actors Michael Imperioli and Victor Colicchio were interested in. Wild, intense, startlingly shot and featuring excellent performances from John Leguziamo, Mira Sorvino and Jennifer Esposito, Summer Of Sam is one of the two or three best films Lee has ever made. It certainly carries echoes of his finest hour, Do The Right Thing . 'There are some parallels,' Lee admits, 'but some of that stuff I never even thought about until people brought it out in the reviews. The whole Italian-American thing is obvious, but I think if you look at the majority of my films they are about intolerance. 'To me it's always been interesting when the lynch mob mentality takes place. It's human nature that we've got to finger someone. Whether they are guilty or not, we've got to hang somebody for the collective good. And in this case, in this film, in this neigh bourhood, [it is] Richie - a very fine performance by Adrien Brody - someone who is from the neighbourhood, but who has gone to the other world, the [Greenwich] Village - and has come back with the fake British accent and the spiked hair. To those guys he's the alien, the freak, so he has to be the Son Of Sam. Because only a serial killer would dress like that.' Interviews with Lee usually seem to end up as battles with journalists eager to take him to task for his supposed anti-Semitism, racism, misogyny, incitement to riot and hypocrisy. Lee, in these interviews, is alternately sulky and arrogant.But sitting in the Dorchester on a cold morning, there's nothing confrontational about him. Small, dressed in a sweat shirt and white trousers, the trademark baseball cap absent, he's a very youthful 42. He is not effusively friendly, but he's certainly not rude. His answers are short, but he takes every question seriously. He smiles, he laughs and he asks questions back. He's quick to credit his cinematographer (Ellen Kuras), editor (Barry Brown), writers and the actors. You'd have to say this is hardly the angriest man in America. Like most directors, he's all too eager to talk about the business of film-making. One of the first things he mentions about his next film - a satire about TV entitled Bamboozled - is that it was shot using the increasingly popular mini digital video format. 'But we're not doing a Dogme thing, we used lights.' Would he be tempted to make a film under the Dogme 95 rules (the school led by Danish director Lars Von Trier that required directors to go back to basics including using only natural light and hand-held cameras)? 'No. I liked Festen but a filmmaker should use the tools that he has to tell the story - make-up, music, a particular lighting. Why not have a club for painters where the only colour we're going to use is red? To join this club, the Redme club, you have to use red. I don't understand the thinking behind that. Do they think they're getting the essence of film-making?' Lee's reliance on music would make a Dogme film tough for him to contemplate. Do The Right Thing was driven by its repeated use of Public Enemy's 'Fight The Power'; Summer Of Sam 's key sequences are edited to The Who's 'Baba O'Riley' and 'Won't Get Fooled Again'. 'Music is a great tool of filmmaking. Maybe tool is not the right word. The way I operate I give the same respect to the music in my film as the cinematography, the production design, the acting, the editing; to me it's just as important a component as everything else. A lot of people might say \"you give too much importance to the music because I can't hear the dialogue\".' It follows that one of Lee's favourite films is West Side Story . 'I would love to do a full musical. And I will do one soon. I don't think it's an obsolete form. I do understand it is hard for audiences to deal with people talking one minute and the next they are breaking into song, but when you think about music videos it shouldn't be that strange.' If it seems unlikely that Lee should be keen on West Side Story , a film now frequently accused of being racist, then that's only the start of the ways that the standard image of the Spike-as-single-minded-polemicist doesn't fit. For a start, the great iconoclast works strictly within the Hollywood system. Since his second movie, School Daze , all his films - including Malcolm X - have had major studio involvement; Summer Of Sam was financed by Disney. Something else you should know about Lee: he's a family man first and foremost. He chooses his films keeping in mind the fact he doesn't want to be away from his children. 'I don't want to be an absentee husband or father. It's a concession I have no problem doing. So all my films will be shot in New York for a while.' He thinks about this. 'But they've been like that anyway.' For the man who scared so many people with Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X , Lee's politics are pretty mainstream too. He's put his money behind the moderate (white) presidential hopeful, Bill Bradley. 'I'm a big supporter of Bradley. I like Clinton very much, but that allegiance doesn't have to translate to his V-P.' Nothing to do with the fact that Bradley used to play basketball for Lee's beloved New York Knicks? 'That had a little of something to do with it...' Finally, there's the talking dog. A friend of mine was hugely bothered by the scene in Summer Of Sam when a dog - voiced by Lee's constant collaborator John Turturro - talks to the Son Of Sam. 'I think that fits perfectly with the chaos, the whole crazy time of the film,' Lee says. 'Here's a man who said a dog told him to go out and do this. So, we always felt that when we were in David Berkowitz's apartment that that's a different world. Who is to say that in that world dogs can't talk? He always said that Harvey, who he said was a 2,000-year-old black labrador, told him to go out and kill. So for us it made sense to show his state of mind.' But Lee has another explanation. A disarmingly simple one. 'We always felt that it was a very funny scene,' he says, hoping that what he's saying is obvious. 'Didn't you find it funny?' It is funny, as Spike Lee films normally are. Of course he is a cinematic troublemaker, but his best works are also sharply written, sexually charged, great-looking and - in the case of the unfairly dismissed Crooklyn - tender. He's anything but a one-dimensional man or director. Years ago, Lee used to say that he would make a film with predominantly white characters when Woody Allen made his black film. Now Lee's gone first: it's your move, Mr Allen. \u0095 Summer Of Sam is released on 14 January Spike's way: Spike through the ages She's Gotta Have It (1986) Lee's playful debut tracks the bedroom antics of the elusive Nola (Tracy Camila Johns) who juggles three men in her life, (one played by Lee himself, who often acts in his own films). Low on budget, high on invention, Lee's debut marked him out as a witty stylist to watch. Do The Right Thing (1989) In one of the key films of the Eighties, Lee concentrates on a long, hot day in the life of a Brooklyn neighborhood, where routine tensions and prejudices threaten to get out of hand. Fuelled by the music of Public Enemy, the film is by turns hilarious and shocking, and never stops asking questions about urban America. Malcolm X (1992) Lee's biopic of the civil rights leader was thought too anonymous by some. It certainly boasted fewer of the stylistic conceits of his earlier movies. But Lee marshalled a tricky narrative with authority and drew a fine performance from Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. Clockers (1995) Lee returns to the familiar territory of Brooklyn, in this adaptation of Richard Price's novel of the same name. Drugs and related violence provide the subject matter, and Lee, not wedded to camera trickery, offers up one of his most sober treatments, marked by impressive ensemble acting, an often overlooked feature of his work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "film/2000/jan/02/3", "type": "article", "sectionId": "film", "sectionName": "Film", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T10:05:37Z", "webTitle": "'Without Fritz, there'd be no Star Wars'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/02/3", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jan/02/3", "fields": {"bodyText": "In 1969, I contributed several thumbnail sketches for a Sunday Times magazine project called 'The 1,000 Makers of the 20th Century', Fritz Lang among them. Lang, then aged 79, was living in California, his reputation seemingly unassailable. He was one of the great artists of the twentieth century, a member of that small group of directors - finite because their achievement could never be repeated - who had produced substantial bodies of work both in the silent era and after the coming of sound. He stood, I suggested, among the seminal artists of our time, one of the half-dozen greatest moviemakers. Twenty years later, and closer to the millennium, the same paper published a revised list. Lang was no longer among them. To find space for post-Seventies directors, the editors had decided that some oldsters had to go. It was as if Giotto had been dropped from The Story of Art to accommodate Damien Hirst. So the year 2000 and the new millennium could not have got off to a better start than with a National Film Theatre Fritz Lang retrospective that, together with its accompanying books and symposiums, should help restore his supremacy. Lang was born in Vienna in 1890, five years before the birth of the cinema, the half-Jewish son of a master-builder who he claimed was a leading architect. Like those other great Austro-Hungarian cinematic geniuses, Erich Von Stroheim and Josef von Sternberg, Lang created himself. Diligent biographers have exposed their lies, myths and seductive glosses, but nowadays we're inclined to accept the advice of the alcoholic newspaper editor in Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance : 'When the legend replaces the truth, print the legend.' But in addition to inventing himself, Lang - along with D.W. Griffith and Stroheim in the United States, Eisenstein and Pudovkin in Russia, Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m and Stiller in Sweden - helped create the very idea of the filmmaker as uncompromising visionary. Together they turned the new profession of movie director into one of the grandest, most powerful, most heroic callings, not just of our century but of all time. The 29-year-old Lang entered the movies in Berlin formidably equipped. He'd studied architecture and law, exhibited paintings, travelled the world, served as an officer in the Austrian army and been wounded four times, published short stories and cartoons. While convalescing at a military hospital in the latter months of the Great War he sold screenplays to German producers. After less than a year as a script editor, he began directing, and over the next decade he made a succession of extravagant movies on vast sets and with long shooting schedules at the UFA studio. Gothic met Bauhaus in his morbid expressionist films and he established a reputation as an uncompromising, dictatorial perfectionist. He was one of the pioneers of the espionage melodrama, the paranoid urban thriller, the historical fantasy epic, the medieval allegory, the science fiction picture both in its dystopian mode (Metropolis) and its hardware rocketry form (Woman on the Moon, the film that invented the countdown). His megalomaniac super-criminal Dr Mabuse is the predecessor of Dr No and Dr Strangelove; Destiny lies behind Bergman's Seventh Seal, and Bergman's first German film, The Serpent's Egg , is an extended homage to Lang; the tyro Hitchcock watched Lang at work in Berlin; the young Kubrick studied his pictures; Star Wars and Blade Runner were anticipated by Lang. His pictures reflected the turbulence of Weimar Germany, a spiralling world of social conflict, unchecked inflation and rapid technological and moral change that led inexorably to the rise of Nazism. The politics of Lang's films were sufficiently confused to make him Hitler's favourite director, and when the Nazis came to power Goebbels offered him the job as head of the Third Reich's new film industry. This, after Lang's brilliantly innovative first talkie, M (1931), had commented ironically on the pact between German authority and the criminal underworld. Lang claims to have fled Berlin the day the Mephistophelean Goebbels made his offer, joining the greatest exodus of talent the world has ever known. He didn't work in Germany again until the late Fifties, when, in the twilight of his career, he made three minor works. Unlike other German exiles - Brecht, Mann, Schoenberg, for example - Lang immersed himself in American culture, driving around the country, reading local newspapers, talking to people, and studying comic strips, which he said gave him insights into slang and humour. But the admiration was reciprocal, because the most adventurous New York comic book editor, Jerry Iger, and his two major prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Will Eisner and Bob Kane (creator of Batman), were Lang fans. In The Great Comic Book Heroes Jules Feiffer writes: 'Eisner was an early master of the German expressionist approach in comic books - the Fritz Lang school... full of dark shadows, creepy angle shots, graphic close-ups of violence and terror.' The coming of sound and the move to America changed Lang's style. His themes remained the same: the quest for self-fulfilment or revenge turning to ashes, the conflict between free will and destiny, the irreconcilable attractions of the femme fatale and the domestic hearth, the relentlessness of a fate that makes a mockery of our dreams. But the abstract, stylised quality of his European pictures is replaced in the United States by a new solidarity and particularity, and fantasy is abandoned. 'American pictures and audiences,' Lang observed, 'are more interested in the fate of the average man, of Joe Doe, whereas in Europe, especially in Germany, in the days before Hitler, they were more interested in a Nietzschean superman.' Consequently he chose to work with classless, unconventional looking heroes - Spencer Tracy (in Fury, Lang's devastating Hollywood debut, an indictment of vigilantism), and several times each with Edward G. Robinson, Henry Fonda, Glenn Ford and Dana Andrews. Lang took immediately to the western, seeing it as a democratic development of the Nibelungen sagas, and Rancho Notorious (his only movie with Marlene Dietrich) is a bizarre classic of what was coming to be called the adult western. His Man Hunt helped create a new genre, the entertainment war flick, and his treatment of the Bonnie and Clyde story in You Only Live Once helped launch the Hollywood film noir , to which his fellow German emigr\u00e9s Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder, Robert Siodmak and Edgar Ulmer contributed. Wilder acknowledges Lang's M as the chief stylistic influence on Double Indemity . Lang also upped the ante on screen violence, staging an almost unendurable fight to the death between Gary Cooper and Marc Lawrence as Lili Palmer looks on in Cloak and Dagger (1946), which Hitchcock borrowed 20 years later for Torn Curtain . He went beyond this to explore pain and disfigurement in The Big Heat (1953), in which Lee Marvin's inner beast emerged to throw a pot of scalding coffee in Gloria Grahame's face. The movie was a turning point in Marvin's career, as Clash By Night had been in Marilyn Monroe's the previous year, and M for Peter Lorre two decades earlier. For years it was the received wisdom that the poems Auden wrote before crossing the Atlantic, Hitchcock's British films and the movies Lang directed before his American exile, were deeper, richer, more truly serious than anything they produced after they arrived in the States. This is not true. Much of their best work was done there, not despite but because of the liberating, broadening effect of the exposure to America, the size and energy of the country. In Hollywood Lang never had the budgets the German cinema had afforded him, nor the respect. But he preserved his massive dignity and lived to see himself f ted as a master in the years before his death in 1976. Peter Bogdanovich published his book-length interview, Fritz Lang in America ; Lotte Eisner's adulatory monograph was translated into English; and, most significantly, in Jean-Luc Godard's Le M\u00e9pris , one of the great movies about movie-making, Lang played himself as the final avatar of classic cinema, turning an ironic eye on a philistine Hollywood producer. I had lunch with Lang once, in Texas in 1972, and was overwhelmed by his charm, his powerful personality (at once imperious, gentlemanly, and friendly) his striking physical presence (the Mount Rushmore head, the eye-patch, the dark glasses that replaced the earlier monocle). I especially remember his comments on Hitchcock and Brecht. The 39 Steps had been shown on TV the night before and, spreading his arms, Lang said: 'How did this film get to be called a classic?' Lang gave Brecht his only Hollywood assignment - as screenwriter on the anti-Nazi melodrama Hangmen Also Die . But to my surprise he had little regard for anything Brecht had written for the theatre after Die Dreigroschenoper and Mahagonny . What he really respected were Brecht's critical writings and his dramaturgical ideas. \u0095 The National Film Theatre's Fritz Lang retrospective begins 3 January.

The remains of the 30,000 who died there at the hands of their Nazi tormentors are scattered over the Latvian soil, marked by a series of simple concrete memorials. It is a name that has little resonance today. Beside the names of the Third Reich's most notorious camps - Auschwitz, Belsen and Dachau - Salaspils has been robbed by the passage of time of its terrible meaning. Last week, however, the ghosts of Salaspils were disturbed following the discovery that one of the men allegedly responsible for its horrors is in Britain. For the camp's few survivors, and for Nazi hunters around the world, a worse prospect still exists: that Konrad Kalejs could leave Britain at any time and escape justice. Tomorrow, Graham Ennis, a leading anti-Nazi war crimes activist, is to lodge a formal complaint against the Chief Constable of Leicester shire, David Wyrko, unless the force acts to prevent Kalejs from fleeing Britain. Ennis, who has the backing of the Simon Wiesenthal centre, has written a series of letters to Wyrko threatening to report him to the Police Complaints Authority if he fails to carry out what Ennis insists is his duty. 'We need to act quickly,' said Ennis. 'This man has spent the past 55 years avoiding prosecution. It is high time he faced justice.' According to numerous witness statements, Kalejs led a death squad responsible for massacring civilians, dumping victims in mass graves and laying waste to villages. As Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Kalejs's entry into Britain, evidence emerged about his alleged participation in wartime atrocities. During a US Department of Justice investigation into Kalejs, now 86, witnesses told how his unit hanged inmates at the Salaspils camp near Riga, the Latvian capital, and stood guard as 30 Gypsies were herded into a pit, shot and buried. One former comrade of Kalejs in the notorious Arajs Kommando torture squad told investigators how a village was burnt down and its people 'exterminated'. He also recounted how another village was levelled and the surviving inhabitants massacred in a revenge attack following the wounding of a German general in battle. Survivors of Salaspils, where Kalejs's unit acted as guards, also described how bodies were collected daily and laid out in a field until mass graves could be prepared. Witnesses who gave evidence at Kalejs's US deportation hearing told how they were forced to watch more than 100 executions and random killings carried out by Latvian guards. However, most of the deaths at Salaspils were from starvation, disease and overwork. The report presented by the Department of Justice concluded: 'The incarceration, forced labour and brutal treatment of the Jews and political prisoners... the killing of civilians at the front, and the execution of gipsies at Porkhov [a camp] were acts of persecution because of race, religion, national origin or political opinion. The respondent [Kalejs] assisted and participated in this persecution.' Kalejs has denied the allegations. Latvian authorities have hinted that they may request Kalejs's extradition if prosecutors find sufficient proof of his alleged crimes. 'An investigation is now being carried out in co-operation with US, Canadian and Australian authorities,' said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Liga Bergman. Kalejs has lived in Australia, Canada and the US, but all have failed so far to bring charges against him. Although activists claim there is ample evidence to condem him, including testimony from other convicted war criminals who claim to have served alongside him, investigations have been hampered by a lack of of living witnesses. The ghost of his past have ensured that Kalejs has spent the past 55 years living as a virtual nomad, often having to leave his home and posessions - and more recently his wife - at a moment's notice in order to stay one step ahead of the prosecutors. Shortly after the war, Kalejs moved to Australia and set up his own construction company. He soon became a multi-millionaire and was granted citizenship in 1957. He then moved to the US in 1959 but was deported in 1994 after immigration authorities found he had assisted in Nazi persecution as a member of the Arjs Kommando. When he left, he took more than $350,000 cash with him. Kalejs returned to Australia and found himself the subject of an inquiry by a special police unit. However, the unit found insufficient evidence to prosecute. Kalejs came closest to being prosecuted when he tried to set up home in Canada. The authorities were tipped off about his background and began a series of investigations. A deportation hearing in had been scheduled in Toronto in mid-1996 but was subjected to a series of delays. By the time a new date was found, Kalejs had disappeared. With Kalejs having surfaced in Britain, Straw has called for a 'full investigation' of how he managed to get here. The inquiry is expected to focus on how immigration officials missed the stamps in his passport declaring that he had been barred entry from America and Canada. It is known he last left Australia in June on a Singapore Airlines flight bound for London. Kalejs entered the UK on an Australian passport and has less than a week to go before his six-month tourist visa runs out on Thursday. He could be deported on the grounds that it was not conducive to the public good for him to remain - or, if the Attorney General decides to take action, he could be arrested and charged under war crimes legislation. Dr Efraim Zuroff, of the Simon Wiesenthal Centre, said 10 to 20 witness statements were faxed last week to Leicestershire police. The investigation has now been taken over by Scotland Yard under the control of Assistant Commissioner David Veness, the Met's leading expert on war crimes. Britain's record on such prosecutions is little better than elsewhere in the world. Out of more than 380 cases investigated by Scotland Yard's special war crimes unit, only two resulted in charges being brought and only one in a conviction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport4", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T11:44:48Z", "webTitle": "King Louis turns his Barca court into a workers' co-op", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport4", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport4", "fields": {"bodyText": "The Nou Camp goes from empty to full in an instant. A couple of minutes before kick-off the Barcelona stadium is almost deserted. A couple of minutes after, there are almost 100,000 fans, the cules (the word means backside) who, it is said, do not eat if their team loses. Founded in November 1899, Barca is the club where football grew biggest in the twentieth century. But the game may now be shrinking. In 100 years, time, the massive Nou Camp could be an historical curiosity whose purpose is no longer recalled, like Stonehenge or the Sphinx. A fortnight ago Barca won their last home match of the century, 2-1 against Atletico Madrid. But even had they lost, the cules would have eaten dinner. The club whose motto used to be 'more than a club' is becoming just another club. Louis van Gaal, Barca's Dutch coach, has changed everything. Against Atletico, the players stuck on the bench and in the stands included Frank and Ronald de Boer, Jari Litmanen, and the Catalan heroes Sergi and Josep Guardiola. Rivaldo, who the next day would be named European Player of the Year, was substituted. Everyone knows Barcelona have a strong bench. Usually this is cited as evidence of the strength of their squad. Yet half the players on the pitch were young unknowns: Puyol, Arnau, Xavi, Zenden and Simao, who came on for Rivaldo. This team has been turned upside down. The cules do not mind Van Gaal dropping the De Boers or Litmanen; the twins have played poorly in Barcelona, which they are thought to consider a holiday venue, while the Finn is generally injured. But you do not bench 'Pep' Guardiola. The local boy - who in 1992 displayed the European Cup with the famous Catalan cry, 'Here you have it!' - had never been dropped in his career. Guardiola is Barcelona, just as Tony Adams is Arsenal, only more so. He is also a perfect player: the playmaker that Van Gaal himself used to be, only better. Seventy-two minutes into the Atletico game the Barcelona bench became unarguably the most prestigious of the century when Rivaldo came to sit beside Guardiola. Soon after the Brazilian trudged to the showers. He wants to play in the centre; Van Gaal has ruled that it is best for the 'collective' if he plays outside-left. Even from there Rivaldo managed 24 goals last season. At nine o'clock next morning Van Gaal held his usual team meeting. At the end of it, Rivaldo asked to speak. He said something like this: 'I have respect for everyone here. But I will never play outside-left again.' A day later Van Gaal expelled him from the squad. Rivaldo was not thinking of the collective, he said. Rivaldo then went on holiday to Brazil. No one knows what will happen next. Whenever Van Gaal's team choices are questioned, he invokes the 'collective'. He says Rivaldo became European Player of the Year thanks only to Barcelona's collective. But when the coach says 'collective', he is really talking about himself. Serving the collective means obeying him. Van Gaal is not crazy. He knows that Rivaldo and Guardiola are great players. But last year everyone said Barcelona had won the league thanks to Rivaldo. Now, if Barcelona win the league, they won't be able to say that. They will have to say that Van Gaal built a strong collective. People also used to say that Van Gaal had barely changed the side. After all, Guardiola still ran things from midfield. Now nobody can say that either. This is Van Gaal's collective: youngsters, brilliant workers like Phillip Cocu and Luis Enrique, and no local heroes or annoying old guys set in their ways. It is a team chosen to suit Van Gaal's character, even if the coach himself does not fully realise it. At first, when he arrived at Barcelona, he tried to recreate the Ajax collective that won him the Champions League in 1995. He signed Patrick Kluivert, Winston Bogarde, Michael Reiziger, later the De Boers and Litmanen. Gradually, however, he must have spotted a change: they had grown older. This mattered little with Kluivert, still only 23. But the De Boers had somehow metamorphosed from gifted youngsters into annoying old guys. And so they have been cleansed. The new collective may win the league for the third time in three seasons, but the cules are turning off. The old heroes have gone. This is a foreign team, even if it has a few young local players. Van Gaal, who barely speaks Spanish let alone Catalan, who shows no liking for the most likeable city in Europe, has stolen the maiden Barca and imprisoned her in a Dutch tactical concept. Barcelona do not report their attendance figures, but the ground has looked less full than usual this season. This is not just Van Gaal's fault. It was inevitable that Barca would lose some of their grip on Catalans. The club mattered most when Franco ruled, when the Nou Camp was the only place you could show you were Catalan. It mattered when Real Madrid won everything. But for most of the 1990s, Barcelona have won the league. For 25 years Catalans have been free to speak their language and wave their flags ad tedium. The ghosts have been slain. The clich\u00e9 says that football is religion. But take that seriously for a minute: religion is dying in western Europe. The churches are empty. Across town from the Nou Camp, Gaudi's famous cathedral is being completed as an aesthetic masterpiece rather than as a place of worship. Football too is losing its meaning, becoming just a spectacle, a sort of fight movie directed by accountants. A century from now, the Barcelona collective could be playing to deserted stands on the indoor handball court near the Nou Camp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/warcrimes.germany", "type": "article", "sectionId": "law", "sectionName": "Law", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T11:44:52Z", "webTitle": "The Nazi behind bars in Britain - and the others on whom suspicion fell", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/warcrimes.germany", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/warcrimes.germany", "fields": {"bodyText": "The Scotland Yard war crimes unit was set up following the introduction of the War Crimes Act of 1991.

Anthony Sawoniuk Anthony Sawoniuk, 78, was found guilty at the Old Bailey of two specimen charges of murdering 18 Jews. The former British Rail ticket inspector was given two life sentences last April after Britain's only successful trial involving Second World War crimes. But witnesses implicated him in the murders of many others, including a baby, in Domachevo, his home town in Belarus, where he served in the police force set up by the invading Nazis. He was also said to have taken part in a massacre of 2,900 Jews on their sacred day, Yom Kippur. He 'executed men and women whose only offence was to be Jewish,' the court heard. Mr Justice Potts told Sawoniuk, who is partially deaf, blind in one eye, diabetic and has heart problems: 'Though you held a lowly rank, a witness said that \"when you became a policeman you became a man of power, a master and a lord\".

Anton Gecas The former Lithuanian, who lives in Scotland, will not be prosecuted despite a four-year investigation costing hundreds of thousands of pounds, the authorities will disclose today. A separate war crimes unit attached to Strathclyde police investigated allegations that Gecas belonged to a Lithuanian police battalion which killed thousands of Jews. Gecas has admitted he joined the battallion, but says he knew nothing about Jews being killed.

A film of The End of the Affair, starring Ralph Fiennes, has just been released. The BBC will broadcast a tie-in called The Beginning of the End of the Affair. And the third and final volume of Greene's authorised biography, by Norman Sherry, is due this year. Amid the howling winds of hype, Shirley Hazzard modestly hopes that 'there is room for the remembrances of someone who knew [Greene] - not wisely, perhaps, but fairly well'. An esteemed novelist with a home on Capri, Hazzard and her late husband were among the few people Greene saw during visits to his own house on the island. Her memoir, Greene on Capri, a pointillist masterpiece, evokes a magical setting while realistically recreating conversations and unpleasant clashes with this most complicated man. She takes his measure down to his fingertips, noting how his palms curled from Dupuytren's contracture, and speculates that he suffered a similar emotional constriction. Despite Greene's expressed longing for 'peace', it was 'the last thing he desired'. He frequently quarrelled with friends, displaying 'a playground will to hurt, humiliate, ridicule'. While he had a wicked sense of humour, 'Graham's pleasure in such jokes derived exclusively from spoofs practised by himself on others'. Would that I had known this before I met Greene. In 1972, I got Greene's address from, predictably, a priest, and wrote to the author. Though he was reputed to be wary of fawning readers and aspiring writers, he invited my wife and me for drinks. Summer nights in Antibes were no longer as tender as they had been during the time of Scott Fitzgerald.

At a block of modern flats, I pressed the buzzer marked Green - was the deleted 'e' for disguise? - and entered a building that had the sterile impersonality of an airport. As Hazzard remarks: 'He was not attached, through habit or memory, or aesthetically, to the rooms and houses and neighbourhoods of his life.' Greene was taller than I expected and his apartment smaller - just a living/work space, bedroom and kitchen. Then 68, he stooped at the shoulders, as if listening closely and looking on with leaky blue eyes. The terrace door let in a din of cars and voices. 'The traffic goes on until all hours,' he lamented, 'and everyone in the building has a barbecue on his balcony. They keep me up half the night. Some mornings I'm almost too tired to work.' Greene had little knack for the continuity of conventional conversation. He preferred anecdotes. As he skipped from topic to topic, listeners had to keep up as best they could. 'I hate to say who I am or what I believe. I told an interviewer I'm gnostic. The next day's newspaper announced that I had become an agnostic.' Here, I thought, was a man who demanded accuracy and strict attention. Greene wrote each morning until he had met his quota, now down to 100 words. 'Just to keep my hand in. I used to work much faster. I liked to bring out a new book every year. It was a reaction against the Bloomsbury people, most of whom seemed content to do a few things, build a reputation and rest on it. Now it takes me years to finish a book, and sometimes it still isn't right.' It puzzled me that practice did not make the process easier. 'You'd think once a writer had been through it a few times and developed confidence in his talent.' 'One has no talent,' Greene interrupted me. 'I have no talent. It's just a question of working, of being willing to put in the time.' This seemed reminiscent of his paradoxical characters who grow strong because they are weak, who are driven to sainthood because they are sinners. Since I had doubts about my own talent, I wanted to believe I would succeed by working hard. And since I could never lead a life as varied as Greene's, I took heart when he said: 'Interesting experiences, fascinating people you meet in extraordinary places - of course that's all very enjoyable, but they don't make one a better writer and they don't always make for good books. Failure and boredom, the feeling of loneliness, of being flat and empty, have more influence on a novelist.' He soon mentioned his mistress, Yvonne Cloetta. She was married to a Swiss, Greene said, who either did not suspect or did not object to his wife's infidelity. This sounded like an indiscreet American, not an Englishman supposedly tight-lipped about his personal life. As my wife admired the sculpture moquettes on a coffee table, Greene said: 'Henry Moore gave me that one. I'm told it's worth \u00a350,000.' Picking up a different piece, silver-plated and phallic, my wife mused that it might be a Brancusi. Greene said he bought it from a chemist in Nice. When she asked whether it came with papers, Greene deadpanned that they recommended using it for itching and inflammation. He had haemorrhoids and this was a medicine applicator. 'It's so decorative - I couldn't bear to throw it away.' In the appalled silence that followed, she set it back on the table and resisted an urge to wipe her fingers on Greene's shirt front. As the butt of his prank, we couldn't fathom his motives. But as Hazzard explains: 'Readiness to hurt even, or especially, those who were fond of him and wished him well, had become a reflex in Graham. . . evidence of the pain he caused gave reality to his own existence, restoring him to his \"better\" self.' In this case, his 'better' self reappeared almost immediately. He gave me a signed, one-of-a-kind copy of The Quiet American with a test cover that had never been released. Then, as we left, he said he would call next week. He did, and took us to a restaurant that served shepherd's pie. Eventually, he introduced us to Yvonne, a pretty woman with a cap of prematurely silver hair. And he continued to unspool vivid vignettes about West Africa during the Second World World, East Africa during the Mau-Mau uprising, the Sinai in 1967, Prague in 1968 during the Russian invasion, Chile, where the CIA monitored his every move. He showed us a book, published at Papa Doc Duvalier's expense, that portrayed Haiti as a tranquil paradise and Greene as an infamous racist. He maintained that he could not be a racist - a branch of his family in the West Indies had black children, one with his name. He spoke about Vietnam, gave an imitation of Diem's hysterical high-pitched laugh and described interviewing Ho Chi Minh after smoking a pipe of opium. He said he had met Fidel Castro in the Sierra Mestre mountains. It was cold at that altitude and Castro's men were freezing. So Greene came back bundled up like an Eskimo and moulted layers of socks, trousers and sweaters. Once Castro came to power, he presented Greene with a painting in gratitude. For years, I dined out on these stories. Then a Playboy editor asked me to write them up. Before I agreed, I got Greene's permission. Despite having flown to South Africa on assignment for the magazine, he expressed misgivings about it, but told me to proceed with the proviso that I did not mention Yvonne. Incorporating all his anecdotes, I cobbled together an adulatory Valentine to Greene. Playboy rejected it as too literary, too unrevealing. My agent failed to place it elsewhere. Finally, I sold it to the Nation for $70 and London Magazine for \u00a330. When I sent Greene a copy, he replied with a scathing rebuke, accusing me of gross inaccuracies and wholesale invention. He took vehement exception to the quote: 'One has no talent. I have no talent.' He threatened to annotate my errors in an article of his own and 'sell it for a large sum'. Furious, I confessed to the journalistic crime of gullibility. 'Why would I write an article which was entirely favourable,' I demanded by mail, 'and continue for two years to try to get it published, if I knew it was full of falsehoods? If the information and anecdotes didn't come from you, where did they come from? Quite frankly, some of them are so good that if I had invented them I would have used them in my own fiction - which is perhaps what you should have done.' There was a second exchange of letters, then silence. Months later, when an Italian magazine asked to reprint the piece, I told Greene this was his chance to set the record straight. He said he could not remember what his objections had been; I was free to republish the article as it stood. In 1988, I again invited Greene to correct any errors. Again he declined and allowed me to include the profile in my collected essays. Over the years, we kept in touch by telephone and he was a faultless correspondent. His letters arrived in distinctive blue-grey envelopes typed by his sister, Elisabeth Dennys. Occasionally, we had lunch at Felix au Port with Yvonne and her golden spaniel, Sandy. He never mentioned the imbroglio. As Hazzard observes, he was not one to apologise. The closest he came to an explanation was the comment that as he got older, his mood swings had flattened - no more manic highs or bleak lows. He attempted to draw a line under the past, but his gnarled fingers traced a jagged arc. Although he sometimes rounded the rough edges off the truth, he remained an amusing raconteur and lively company. Late in his life, he generously offered to sell me his house on Capri. Still, he never lost that splinter of ice in his novelist's heart. (Hazzard declares Greene's 'splinter' was 'the tip of an iceberg'.) When his long-time publisher did not like the title Travels With My Aunt, he shot off a telegram: 'Easier to change publishers than title.' In 1979, the New Yorker published a profile of Greene, which he dismissed in a letter to the New Statesman as the 'products of Mrs [Penelope] Gilliatt's rather wild imagination. . . It will be safer. . . to assume that almost anything there I am made to say is probably - to put it kindly - inaccurate.' I felt sorry for poor Penelope - until I read the piece. It opened with Greene on the terrace in Antibes talking about noisy neighbours. That sounded familiar, as did her description of his eyes, his stooped shoulders, his work schedule, his travels in Dubcek's Prague and Allende's Chile. When I reached the quote, 'I have no talent. It's just a question of working, of being willing to put in the time', I wondered whether this was plagiarism or a cruel practical joke. Had Greene told Gilliatt the same tales and enticed her into repeating them? No, the New Yorker conceded, she lifted sections of my article and the magazine made a financial settlement. After the story broke in the New York Times , I visited Greene. He had not noticed similarities between Gilliatt's article and mine. He was too busy delighting in the d\u00e9bcle. In 1991, days before his death, I sent Greene a letter. Weeks later, a familiar blue-grey envelope arrived. Like Scobie in The Heart of the Matter , who receives reversed telegrams - the first saying his daughter's dead, the second that she's in hospital - I experienced a pang of absurd hope. But it was a note from his niece saying Graham was gone and we would all miss him. As Henry Walston, the husband of another of Greene's mistresses, put it, if this contrary writer often caused pain, he also gave great pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "books/2000/jan/02/adammarsjones", "type": "article", "sectionId": "books", "sectionName": "Books", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T14:13:35Z", "webTitle": "Aroma therapy", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/02/adammarsjones", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/jan/02/adammarsjones", "fields": {"bodyText": "The strangest moment in this fevered and sometimes disgraceful book comes when Nicholas Fox Weber finds a use for his nose as an instrument of research. He is the guest of Balthus and his Japanese wife Setsuko in Switzerland. The great artist chain-smokes, but 'in the brief intervals between cigarettes, he was as scent-free as a little boy - if there was any odour at all that emanated from the octogenarian, it was butterscotch'. How close do you have to be to someone not only to detect a smell but to assert that he smells of nothing? During this visit to Balthus in 1990, Weber is, by his own account, star-struck and unquestioning, although this doesn't stop him from finding Balthus's alleged absence of aroma revealing as a symbol of a state of psychological arrest. Later, Weber becomes disillusioned, finding Balthus dishonest about his work and, worse, his ethnicity, and then there are no psychobiographical holds barred. Balthus was born in 1908 to Erich and Baladine Kolossowski, prosperous aesthetes and artists. When he was 11, his mother Baladine took as her lover no less a figure than Rainer Maria Rilke, who encouraged the boy's precocious talents. In fact, they collaborated on a book when Balthus was 14. Rilke wrote an essay introducing Balthus's drawings of a cat that a boy befriends and then loses. This sounds an enviably ideal start for an artist, but Weber proposes (without evidence) that the boy 'must have been constantly alert' to the ups and downs of passion between Rilke and Baladine, as a result of which the 'intertwining of ecstasy and torment would permeate Balthus's art forever after'. Clearly it's frustrating to have a painter willing to answer questions and then to hear him say that he paints what he sees, when his earlier work has an explicit sexual charge and even in his late paintings the young girls have a suspect glow. But artists are under no obligation to interpret their work. A quarter of this long book is devoted to the seven extraordinary paintings which made up Balthus's first solo exhibition in 1934. The artist has since owned up to a certain desire to shock, in images that combined a confrontational sexuality with classical control, but for Weber this was Balthus at his most honest about his obsessions. Yet, to make his case, he has to go in for a lot of misrepresentation. The distressed woman in The Window, for instance, does not, despite Weber, meet the viewer's eyes, and so cannot represent the victim of an assault by the artist. It's an intense reaction, but to something or someone we don't see. It's Weber who chooses to supply Balthus as her assailant, his paintbrush standing in for a knife. One painting at the 1934 show has been notorious ever since: The Guitar Lesson, where the (female) teacher plays the pupil rather than the instrument. Weber describes the teacher as digging talon-like fingers into the girl's inner thigh, though he also uses the less violent word 'strumming'. Describing The Guitar Lesson, Weber tries to establish an exact 'sequence of events', asserting that the teacher 'has probably given this sort of lesson before', while the pupil 'will grow from being a little girl in her cardigan and pinafore into a mature woman in seductive silk'. Is it art criticism to say of a painted figure that 'the girl's labia pulse'. In our century, and Freud's, psychological awareness has driven out the pictorial kind, a shift that Balthus both exploits and resists. These days, it is only confessions of trauma that are taken at face value. Perhaps he would have been cannier in presenting his art to the world to have done as his younger contemporary, Louise Bourgeois, did and insisted on the element of autobiography instead of declaring it off-limits. A Bourgeois sculpture is, in effect, firmly labelled, 'This is my revenge on daddy for betraying me by sleeping with the nanny', while Balthus has the labels attached by Weber instead. Art criticism as practised here is a sort of dismal centrifuge, whereby a picture is separated into layers of pigment and trauma. It is the precipitate of conjectural psychic damage which seems to hold the writer's attention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "books/2000/jan/02/society", "type": "article", "sectionId": "books", "sectionName": "Books", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T14:16:02Z", "webTitle": "Enslaved to the state", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/02/society", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/jan/02/society", "fields": {"bodyText": "Are women in Western society liberated or not? Nobody seems to agree. According to a recent report by the American Psychological Association, the modern woman is depressed, exhausted from the burdens of work and domestic responsibilities. On the other hand, nobody can deny the flowering of opportunities for women such as easy access to contraception, the growing affordability of childcare and anti-sexual discrimination employment laws. These have created a new, ambitious, 'ladette' generation. At a time when women's future looks so rosy, it's depressing to find that the way women exercise free choice in their personal lives troubles an increasing number of journalists, feminists and policy-makers. How women decide to negotiate sexual relationships, their style of parenting and their attitude to home life are under constant scrutiny. They are said to be in need of all kinds of professional advice and state protection in their personal lives. But a culture promoting anxiety about women's personal choice and a reliance on professionals and the state will make women less able to make free choices. Melanie Phillips, formerly of The Observer and author of The Sex-Change Society, begins her assault on contemporary moral values by questioning the motivations of mothers who live independently of men. As she puts it: 'For freedom, see selfishness; for independence, see abandonment.' Stressing that women should be allowed to be single or work if they want to, Phillips argues that marriage continues to be in their best interests once they have children. The traditional family is more likely to get women out of poverty, satisfy the father's needs and guarantee children's happiness and safety. Her other main target is policy-makers who wish to feminise the state and codify these new lifestyle arrangements at the expense of marriage. Policy-makers want men to feel and care like women and for women to be forced to work like men. Phillips provides an impressive body of research to counter gender assumptions. Each page details statistical errors, which she calls 'the gender equivalent of Stalin's Big Lie'. In fact, she says, the majority of adults desire marriage and don't experience domestic violence. As she rightly points out, the new thinking demonises men and masculinity as if women were saints and feminine traits were intrinsically better. This book is a welcome antidote to anyone worried about New Labour's interference in personal relationships. Despite all the Government's non-judgmental rhetoric, Phillips shows how women are encouraged to become independent of men, yet dependent on the state. State-provided childcare seems to offer liberation for women, yet is it free choice when poorer lone mothers are dragooned into attending DSS interviews to qualify for nursery places? These mothers cannot chose their own childcare but have to accept whatever the state offers, or look after their children at home in poverty. What undermines Phillips's argument, however, is that it is based on the generalisation that when women become mothers their behaviour changes according to female instinct. She claims this is why nurturing children is crucial to a woman's identity whereas a father's identity is reliant on seeking work. Public policy, she argues, should reflect this fact and reward marriage as the ideal. Yet if anyone should make moral judgments about the best way to bring up children and conduct personal relationships - whatever their instincts - it is the people concerned, not politicians. This is what free choice means. Of course, a woman's decision may not guarantee happiness. Those who reject marriage and men are sometimes miserable and poor. Far from being a problem of too much 'selfish' choice, as Phillips argues, this shows how women's view of choice has narrowed. She is correct to say that a culture that celebrates women's physical independence from men as a panacea for all ills - emotional or economic - is a problem. It reduces women's choice in terms of relationships to either living alone or being enslaved in a marriage. This isn't the only way of looking at life. What about choosing to persevere with a partner who can help you? What she ignores, however, is how limited perceptions of economic choice influence women's lives. Arguing that it is not economic liberation which mothers need, but men, falls into the feminist and conservative trap: that society's economic problems can be resolved by changes in personal behaviour in relationships. So does feminism have anything to offer? Lynne Segal's new book Why Feminism? corrects the view that feminism means being anti-men. Like Phillips, she believes women can't chose to have it all. The difference is that Segal believes feminism offers a way for women to question society, using their experiences as a guiding rod to emancipation. Feminism provides the 'potential, however complex and difficult, to connect personal and cultural issues to economic and political affairs'. Refreshingly, she calls on women to become politically active and not just accept their identities. Yet how useful is personal experi ence in discussions of social progress? Segal argues that in an era when women's choices are circumscribed by welfare cuts, most mothers continue to 'prefer dependence on the state to their experience of dependence on a man'. No doubt all women (and men, for that matter) could cite an example where dependence on somebody caused disappointment, or worse. Nobody should be forced to be dependent on others, but strengthening their relationships with the state is no alternative. The state will always dictate the terms of the relationship. If this is all women have to look forward to, what kind of choice will they really have?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "books/2000/jan/02/1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "books", "sectionName": "Books", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T14:17:00Z", "webTitle": "Paperbacks", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jan/02/1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/books/2000/jan/02/1", "fields": {"bodyText": "SOLIBO MAGNIFICENT Patrick Chamoiseau Granta \u00a36.99, pp190 Amid the intoxicating noise and colour of carnival in Fort-de-France, Martinique, the renowned storyteller Solibo Magnificent falls dead in the marketplace in the middle of a performance. Onlookers are convinced he's been strangled by his own story, his 'throat snickt by the word', but the police suspect murder, and two local officers, Evariste Pilon and Phil\u00e9mon Bouaffesse, are assigned to unravel the mystery. It is a thankless task: the market crowd, steeped in the oral traditions of their region, respond to the officers' interrogations by embarking on vast, fantastical adventures in the realm of discourse, an extraordinary display of the myriad possibilities of language, but not exactly the hard facts the police are looking for. There is a plot of sorts, but the characters' refusal to abide by the conventions of the police procedural genre into which they have been incongruously plunged is part of the point of Chamoiseau's exhilarating, energising novel. DUANE'S DEPRESSED Larry McMurtry Orion \u00a36.99, pp373 It's not so much the fact that Texas oilman Duane Moore leaves Karla, his wife of 40 years, to live in a cabin in the hills that leaves his family and town aghast and worried for his health, it's the fact that he walks out on her. Duane has driven a pickup for as long as he can remember; neither he, nor anyone else he knows, has ever walked anywhere. Karla, a worrier, is sure he is insane; his druggie children and delinquent grandchildren are simply baffled. Duane doesn't know why he's left, either. 'Without exactly knowing it, he had reached a point in his life where he had to live differently if he was to live at all,' writes McMurtry, 'and his feet and legs, somehow recognising that fact before he had been able to face it consciously, had hurried him away and saved him.' A moving journey of self-discovery, Duane's story is told in McMurtry's trademark deadpan style, free of sentimentality, and is often hilarious, despite its subject matter. ISAIAH BERLIN: A LIFE Michael Ignatieff Vintage \u00a38.99, pp356 As the foremost liberal intellectual of his century, Isaiah Berlin's political philosophy stressed the inevitability of moral diversity and the dangers inherent in any quest for ethical uniformity. It's tempting to seek the source of Berlin's thought in the extraordinary multiplicity of the environments in which he moved, first as a Latvian emigrant and subsequently as a British diplomat, in a life which brought him into contact with the era's foremost personalities and political movements. He couldn't have hoped for a more assiduous biographer than Ignatieff, whose approach, a combination of admiration and criticism when it is required, makes this much more than an authorised biography. BRAVE NEW WORLDS: GENETICS AND THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE Bryan Appleyard HarperCollins \u00a38.99, pp197 Appleyard's fierce polemic traces the most exciting and alarming developments in modern science, from the announcement in a Cambridge pub of the discovery of DNA to recent panics over cloning, designer babies and genetically modified crops, a roll-call of the ethical dilemmas that have defined the past few years. Appleyard's accounts of the various controversies are solid and engaging, but it his elegant, concise closing essay that makes this book worth buying. In it, he rails against the spread of the ideology of scientism and calls for the formulation of a coherent set of values with which we can evaluate the products of our scientific age. HITCHCOCK'S SECRET NOTEBOOKS Dan Aulier Bloomsbury \u00a311.99, pp567 How many revisions did the screenplay of Shadow of a Doubt undergo? What title did Alfred Hitchcock really prefer for the film that ended up being called Suspicion ? How did studio artists initially envisage the famous avian attack scenes in The Birds ? Aulier's vast centennial compilation of Hitchcock documents, story treatments, memos, storyboards, telegrams and correspondence answers these questions and thousands more. But a more pertinent one for the lay reader might be: how much do we care? Hitchcock's Secret Notebooks is strictly for the Hitch obsessive; fans whose commitment to the cause is only moderately strong may well baulk at this doorstopping storehouse of behind-the-scenes detail. Not that parts of it aren't fascinating - the assiduous opinion-polling that preceded the titling of Hitchcock's movies even in the early Forties, for example, and numerous demonstrations of the single-mindedness and terrifying attention to detail that defined the director's genius.

The humour is pungent. Literary references abound - Paulin is constantly moving to innovate and create variations on a theme. The language is striking and fresh, within which 'there's this wee skelf/that might just be the jag the gouge the problem'. The work is both inviting and troubling in its psychological implications. But, above all, this book is about sound - not just 'music', but the sound of being, of oppression, of liberation, of surprise and humour: how cauld it is out on air for the very first time but not gross and crass as the first studio in Belfast its acoustic deadness - every wall and bit of furniture muffled not a shred of echo - where a cheery good day or - it's Tyrone Guthrie talking - a ringing roundelay fell with a dull thud The language compels us to listen, to hear it - to absorb its silences, the spaces between these busy notes. The geographies of Northern Ireland come through in fragments - like the 'wind dog' - pieces of a rainbow. The genius of Paulin's poetry is that it shatters definitions. Not purely a poetry of late modernism, deploying postmodernist techniques, neither is it a poetry simply of the lyrical self. It is deeply informed by the essence of the word and the music of the spoken: poetry both of the page and of performance. It is political lyrical poetry that historicises the ego-I, taking the lyrical self into a public arena. It might be the future of English-language poetry - a hybridising organic entity, responding to change and recollection. Art in a Paulin poem is not the static contemplative entry point which it is for other poetry, but a parallel universe in which possibilities play a part, producing a language in themselves. It's about the political ramifications of the process, what gets seen and remembered, as much as the object itself. What, it seems to be asking, is the gap between intention and perception? Marc Chagall, the Jewish Russian painter who spent much of his life living in France, haunts and enriches Paulin's poetic voice itself, hovers over this book. Paulin associates and draws on Chagall as an artist as well as through his painting. He writes of his 'childhood shtetl', and taps into localities of universal suffering. 'Marc Chagall, Over the Town' captures this: Marc and Bella are flying happily over Vitebsk - they've shucked off the iron husk of place and like two salmon trout 've leapt high above the flood above war revolutions pogroms - this is a real a shining good but if you look closely there's a lout squatting on the mud... and how quite a few critics of T.S. Eliot choose either to forgive or forget those bits of verse and one piece of coldly sinister prose that're about his fear and hatred of all Jews The lines referring to Eliot are more than just a rebuke of a poet's anti-semitism - they're a challenge to the complacencies which can arise and then endure within the modernist project. Paulin writes political poetry that is vital without being polemical. He builds up textual allusions and breaks down the absolute nature of place and experience. As we read, we move with him on a journey through symbolic and real political considerations. His Drumcree poems are testament to this. The Wind Dog contains some astounding imitations or versions of other poets, along with deceptively simple light verse, and detailed explorations of language, including a recognition of the possibilities outside standard English. The underlying and lasting strength of Paulin's poetic voice lies in the ambiguity between its certainty and its insecurity - the irony of 'Fortogiveness' epitomises this. It tackles the tricks that language can play, the truth of the dialect. The long title poem 'The Wind Dog' is one the reader will return to. A construct of quotes remade by their new context, it uses the growth of the individual as a cumulative referencing device. An exploration of culture, history and childhood, a geography of reading and music interplay and fuse with the formation of the poetic identity, as the persona is 'date[d]... in a carbon childhood.' It is part Prelude, part stripped back and deconstructed ballad. It is biblical - the rainbow only part-present though - and intra-cultural. It is also a beautiful anti-epic built from threads and scraps of other people's writings, voices and histories, all woven together. It tells of the stories of childhood shaping places through their sounds - 'I'm a child... that reads and hears but doesn't understand'. The poem travels further and further back through the strata of what makes the individual. Yeats is confronted and undone: 'for out of Ireland have we sort of come' - as too are numerous other texts. Paulin recognises the temporal nature of language - postmodern pastiche on one level, but also more than this - an investigation of the lyric in the context of the self. Finally, what you recognise on reading the first poem is vivid musicality. But it is so easy - too easy - to 'dismiss' a deeply intellectual poetry with a reference to sound, and the pleasure it evokes, and then habitually to characterise all Irish poetry this way. Paulin deploys his musicality with very specific intent. Even his 'jangles' are politically aimed and have the dynamism of Joyce. Like Joyce, Paulin simultaneously makes the past, the present and the future live - and in doing so he has created his own space."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/02/russia.chechnya", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T16:39:16Z", "webTitle": "Victory in Grozny set to cost Putin dearly", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/02/russia.chechnya", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/02/russia.chechnya", "fields": {"bodyText": "Less than 18 hours after moving into the Kremlin, the seat of supreme power in Russia since time immemorial, Vladimir Putin hurried south bearing lethal New Year gifts. The new Russian strongman's five months as Prime Minister are bathed in Chechen blood. And in one of his first acts as Acting President yesterday, Putin went to the war that has been the key to his dizzying rise to power. In Chechnya's Russian-held second city of Gudermes -- the place that Putin wants to turn into a showpiece new Chechen capital when his troops have fininished flattening Grozny - the new leader dispensed engraved hunting knives to Russia's new, if temporary, war heroes. It was a calculated, cold-blooded gesture, redolent with the symbolism of Putin's New Russia. Meanwhile, his Kremlin crony, Boris Berezovsky, the media mogul whose television station has been so important in creating the Putin phenomenon, danced in the new century at a sumptuous ball at the Bolshoi costing $1,500 a head. But Berezovksy's cameras were on hand to show Putin live on television at 6am yesterday standing in Chechnya, handing out knives, and vowing to halt 'the break-up of the Russian Federation'. While tens of thousands of ordinary Muscovites thronged Red Square outside Putin's new office, to usher in the new year and hail a new President, there was no millennium celebration for the workaholic 46-year-old former spy and bureaucrat. At 2am Putin and his wife wrapped themselves in winter parkas, clambered aboard the presidential aircraft and headed for Gudermes. 'Better late than never,' he quipped to the Russian troops. 'We had to turn back and finish the journey by car. Sorry it took so long.'A wry sense of irony, perhaps, since the last thing Putin can be accused of is shilly-shallying. On the contrary, the lightning visit to Chechnya in the middle of the millennial night again highlighted the energy, the action, the dynamism that is such a strong element of the new leader's appeal to Russians. And the hunting knives sent a chilling signal of toughness, determination and violence. Since late on Christmas Eve, 25 miles to the west of Gudermes, thousands of Russian troops have been slogging through the mud and mist of a battered city the Russians themselves built as a fortress and a garrison 170 years ago. Young lads from Siberia, from the Urals, from the Don basin have spent the entire week haplessly trying to wish their political and military bosses a very 'Happy New Year' by vanquishing Grozny. The conquest of the city - a graveyard for the Russian army five years ago this weekend - would put a holiday spring in the steps of the generals disgraced the last time around and bring a smile to Putin's poker face. Grozny will fall soon to the Russians. But it hasn't fallen yet, although yesterday the Russians reported breaking through rebel lines in their advance towards the city centre from three directions. But while that fortress continues to defy Putin's iron will, Russia's most famous fortress, the Kremlin itself, fell to the man who says he is committed to restoring Russia to its heyday as a great power. At noon on Friday, Boris Yeltsin signed a decree instantly stepping down after two terms as President and handing all his powers to Putin until new presidential elections are held at the end of March. Putin said he would perform as both President and Prime Minister at least until the new State Duma, or lower house, convenes later this month. And then came the pay-off. Putin immediately signed a new presidential decree guaranteeing Yeltsin and his family immunity from prosecution. It remains unclear when Yeltsin finally decided to go, but it seems the decision was taken only in the last few days. The fallout from the Duma election a fortnight ago today was sensational, confirming the Putin phenomenon and establishing the Prime Minister as the most popular and most formidable force in Russian politics. The Yeltsin camp, which created Putin as a politician and which sees him as a protector of its interests, started leaking rumours that Yeltsin might go early to capitalise on Putin's high opinion poll ratings, making him the runaway favourite for the presidency. Earlier this week, Kremlin aides were told to go shopping for a new country dacha for Yeltsin in the exclusive district of Odintsovo, outside Moscow, though they say they did not know he was about to quit. But the immunity deal agreed with Putin also provides Yeltsin with a new state-owned dacha. Yeltsin also gets a pension, a car, bodyguards, and the attention of the same medical experts who have been treating his heart disease and sundry other ailments. The first public sign that changes were afoot came last Thursday when Yeltsin, at short notice, cancelled his appearance at a Kremlin reception that evening at which he had been due to deliver a major speech on Russia and the new millenium. This new-year reception is traditionally hosted by the Mayor of Moscow, but the incumbent, Yury Luzhkov, is the main political enemy of Yeltsin and Putin, so the Kremlin camp hijacked the occasion. Putin, not Yeltsin, appeared. Kremlin aides say that was the day the deal was done. The President's televised New Year address to the nation always takes place at 10 minutes to midnight. It is always pre-recorded. Yeltsin scrapped his original address, called the cameras to his Kremlin office on Friday morning and dropped his valedictory bombshell. Just before that, Yeltsin had called in Patriarch Aleksey, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Putin, and the other 'power' Cabinet members - the Ministers of the Interior, Defence, and Foreign Affairs - to tell them the news. He then cleared out his office, ushered in Putin, told him 'this is your office now', got into his official limousine, and drove out of the Kremlin after eight tumultuous years. Less than 12 hours later it was Putin who was addressing the nation, his straight face peering down on thousands of partying Muscovites from giant video screens in Red Square. Magnanimous in his hour of triumph, he saluted Boris Yeltsin's 'huge achievements. It will be some time before we can really appreciate how much this man did for Russia.' And for Vladimir Putin. The new President's biggest and most immediate challenge - as testified by yesterday's surprise visit - is Chechnya. In the week-old ground battle for Grozny - the storming that isn't a storming, as one Moscow newspaper dubbed it - tens of thousands of Russian troops have been inching forward fearfully, backed by overwhelming artillery and tank fire, to run into a couple of thousand nimble urban guerrillas who know every yard of their city. Putin's main appeal is that he promises Russia will walk tall again. He promises to make the people and the army feel good about themselves again. And he cheerfully pockets the political dividend. In a policy initiative last week, his first apart from the war, Putin drew on Soviet and Tsarist custom and practice to sketch out his new model Russia: collectivist, patriotic, powerful. Above all, it is the State, not the individual, that is at the core of the new leader's vision. The Russian media are on-message. The parliament, the army, the security bodies and virtually all the political parties across the spectrum are supportive. The public backs the war. Yeltsin's last speech before his resignation statement described the military campaign as 'faultless'. Putin told his troops yesterday in Gudermes: 'This is not simply about restoring honour and dignity to the country. No, this is about more serious things. This is about how to bring about the end of the break-up of Russia. That is your fundamental goal.' But it is not only Russian and Chechen blood that is being spilt. Russian honour is being spent in Chechnya. Moscow has had three years to get to grips with the problems of Chechnya, and it has barely even bothered to try. Its vast security and intelligence apparatus was entirely capable, given the political green light, of launching a targeted policing operation to deal with the 'bandits and terrorists'. Instead, a city about the size of Edinburgh is being flattened for the second time in five years, terrifying 'aerosol' bombs are reducing the mountains to cinders in pursuit of a few thousand guerrillas, and hundreds of thousands of people have been left homeless to rescue the reputations of Russian generals and secure Putin's rise to the top. Last week marked a watershed in Russia, with Yeltsin passing the baton to a man 22 years his junior. And this week's battle for Grozny marks a turning point in the current three-month war. Putin has been in a hurry, operating to a timetable dictated by the exigencies of elections. The rebels are playing a longer game. Russian airstrikes and artillery barrages are less advisable when the territory is garrisoned by Russian troops. The battle for Grozny is the first significant time that the Chechens have sttod and fought. And the Chechens will take the war to the Russians once their country is under Russian occupation. It is Vladimir Putin's war. But the new Russian leader will soon have to prove that he is capable of much more than fighting wars. Putin and Igor Sergeyev, his Defence Minister, insist that the war is almost over. The commander of the Chechen guerrillas, Shamil Basayev, who is Russia's public enemy number one, says the fighting has hardly begun."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport6", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T16:49:13Z", "webTitle": "United missing in action, but not missing much", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport6", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport6", "fields": {"bodyText": "Where on the scale of tediousness would you rate the last couple of days? Down there with gossip about the state of Vanessa Feltz's marriage? Or lower, round about the point at a dinner party when someone mentions house prices? There we were, enduring the longest period of enforced idleness in this country's history, and for some reason we have been deprived of the traditional seasonal outlet for pudding-induced frustration, namely a full sporting programme on New Year's Day. The assumption made by the fixture czars was that we would all be too over-excited after watching the River of Fire (or Puddle of Steam as it was better known) to make it down to our local football stadium, rugby ground or race track. And so, instead of burning off excess calories hurling abuse at an inept full-back, we were obliged to pass yet another afternoon in front of a bunch of ancient movies, accompanied only by a tin of Celebrations. Deprived of sporting action to absorb, the symptoms of withdrawal played strange games in my mind. On BBC1 on New Year's Day, for instance, in the space normally taken up by Football Focus and Final Score, we were treated to The Sound Of Music. As Julie Andrews led her adopted family of wide-eyed youngsters on a daring assault on the highest of peaks, pursued at every step by the forces of darkness, I found it impossible not to see the film as a sort of musical commentary on David O'Leary's Leeds United. At the same time over on Channel 4 was The Man Who Knew Too Much, surely a telling gloss on the tortured intellectual of Highbury, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. Meanwhile on Sky you could see Jurassic Park: The Lost World, in which a bunch of ante-diluvian creatures trundle around the greensward to ultimately futile purpose, much in the manner of Gianluca Vialli's creaking Chelsea pensioners. Sadly, no programme controller seized the moment to schedule a timely commentary on Manchester United's new year in the shape of Costa-Gavras's classic film Missing. Thus this afternoon, at long last, we will head off to matches in the fond belief that the new year marks a new start for our team. For a moment, we will hope that an inverse millennium bug has struck and those long-standing inadequacies have somehow disappeared with a change in the date. Some of us might even be fooled by the law of averages into assuming that some time in this decade, this century, this millennium, our centre-forward must surely score. But for followers of those teams with a chance of winning the Premiership, the coming month represents a strange phoney war. With the champions bleaching their highlights down on the Copacabana, now is the opportunity for their rivals to toast absent friends by putting points in the bank, knowing that in the scramble of early May, points are more valuable than games in hand. Yet, Sir Alex Ferguson will head off to the sun feeling he need not invest in binoculars to spot his rivals on his return. True, after losing at Highbury, the leaders Leeds have been blessed with as close to a formality as the Premiership throws up these days with a home game against Aston Villa. If anything, Arsenal have landed an even easier run-out at Hillsborough. After that, though, what with the intervention of that old-fashioned inconvenience known as the FA Cup, the two clubs' only other opportunity to bank points in United's absence sees them both taking on Sunderland. It is the kind of schedule which might have conspiracy theorists speculating that the fixture computer is programmed by a man in a red-and-white shirt. Indeed it is possible to suggest that when the Manchester United boys come back from Brazil, their knowledge no doubt hugely advanced by the tactical problems set by South Melbourne, they will discover their rivals have accrued no more than four points apiece. Even better, if a club official managed to pick up some hardy seedlings on the pampas, they might even have grass to play on at Old Trafford on their return."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "film/2000/jan/02/philipfrench", "type": "article", "sectionId": "film", "sectionName": "Film", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T17:20:00Z", "webTitle": "Dogma", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/02/philipfrench", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jan/02/philipfrench", "fields": {"bodyText": "Keith Smith's Dogma is a comic theological road movie about two renegade angels (Matt Damon, Ben Affleck), permanently exiled by God to Wisconsin, who discover that they have the opportunity to re-enter Heaven through a dogmatic loophole offered by a New Jersey church.

The New Year's resolution showed by England's openers wasn't the only novel feature of a fluctuating day. Jonty Rhodes dropped a catch, South Africa dismissed Nasser Hussain, and Michael Vaughan turned a promising 20 into a promising 40. Some thought Rhodes was lucky even to be on the field in place of Nantie Hayward, particularly when, three days earlier, South Africa had racked up 572 for 7, having taken nearly two days to bowl out England. But at least it put an end to the absurd situation of having five fast bowlers - and the batting now has a more balanced look, with Donald able to drop a place to No.10. Rhodes should probably never have been sacrificed in the first place - South Africa's problem is that the man who most deserved to go is the captain. Hussain played the least adventurous innings of the day, but beat one of cricket's least trumpeted records, passing Hanif Mohammad's record of 970 minutes between dismissals (Hanif himself maintains that it was 999 minutes, but, either way, Hussain is the first man to reach 1000). But after he was out, around the 1020 mark, it was refreshing that England at last found someone other than their three elder statesmen to make some runs. Michael Vaughan may only be 40 not out, but he again played with the sort of assurance rare among fresh-faced middle-order batsmen \u00d0 particularly English ones. His driving was compact and his judgement outside off stump generally sound. England need him to go on tomorrow. Atherton admitted that England were disappointed to make 215 for 5 in the day, especially after scoring 89 in the first session, although a third-consecutive first-innings total of 350 is not impossible. They only have themselves to blame. Well though Donald bowled, the 4 in his wickets column is something of a sleight of hand: three of his victims played themselves in, only to play into the hands of Gary Kirsten in the deep, while the decision to promote Andy Caddick to nightwatchman with almost half an hour to go was as brainless as it was cowardly. Ducks don't come much more predictable. The feeling persists that England are still not making the most of some good positions. Yes, they are getting better; no, they can't lose 5-0. But to score 126 runs in two sessions (in this case 62 overs) is the act of self-conscious underdogs. They still have a long way to go if they are to start translating promise into results.

Kohl was alone inside with his wife Hannelore as he read a statement from Bonn's public prosecutor announcing a full-scale criminal investigation into the veteran politician's financial dealings. In a terse statement issued through a spokesman in Berlin, Kohl expressed regret at the prosecutor's decision and promised to co-operate with the investigation into secret donations to his Christian Democratic Union (CDU). But he gave no sign that he is about to break his silence over the identity of the donors who handed him hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash during his 16 years in power. Kohl's refusal to name the donors has transformed a scandal into a catastrophe for his Christian Democrats, who face financial disaster in the shape of heavy fines for breaking rules on party funding. Worse still, as poll ratings plummet, the party that Kohl led for a quarter of a century is on the verge of a split that could destroy it. 'Nobody in the party wants a split, we want unity. If Helmut Kohl would name the donors or the donors themselves would release him from his word of honour, we would have the solution to the problem,' Angela Merkel, the CDU's general secretary said. Kohl has admitted accepting up to Dm2 million (\u00a3660,000) in cash from anonymous donors between 1993 and 1998 and channeling the funds to CDU branches via secret accounts. German law requires political parties to identify donors of sums greater than Dm20,000 and the CDU could face heavy fines for its failure to do so.The party has also lost out on matching funds from the state worth 50 per cent of every private donation it receives. A report issued by the party on Friday revealed that Kohl received almost half a million marks more than he admitted between 1993 and 1996. Dm100,000 went to his local party organisation - contrary to Kohl's claims that he used the slush fund to prop up the CDU in the impoverished east of the country. 'I could never be bribed. I have never taken money for myself, nothing has ever gone into my personal, private account. I was party chairman for 25 years, unpaid, without compensation,' Kohl declared before Christmas. Kohl insists that he cannot break the promise he gave to donors that they would remain anonymous. But his critics suspect that the real reason for his silence is that some of the money he received may not have been declared by the donors for tax purposes. Prosecutors in Frankfurt are investigating three anonymous legacies worth a total of more than Dm12 million that the CDU received from Switzerland and Liechtenstein between 1989 and 1996. A Liechtenstein-based lawyer close to Kohl organised two of the transfers but the origin of the donations remains unknown. Although Kohl has only admitted receiving donations between 1993 and 1998, prosecutors are investigating payments that may have been made long before that period. They are also likely to investigate links between Kohl's accountant and a Swiss bank. Most Germans believe the former Chancellor when he says that he did not take any money for himself and many accept his claim that no government decisions were influenced by donations to party. But questions surround a Dm1 million cash payment from an arms dealer that may have been linked to the government's approval of a lucrative arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Another large donation came from a property company that bought privatised housing at Dm1 billion less than the price offered by the highest bidder. The scandal has also revived interest in the controversial sale of an eastern German oil refinery to the French oil company Elf Aquitaine in the early Nineties. The government has confirmed recently that important files relating to the sale have disappeared. With few of his fellows willing to weigh into Kohl in public, it has been left to the 45-year-old Merkel to play Cordelia to Kohl's Lear, spelling out the truth that others feared to utter. In an open letter to Kohl published before Christmas, Merkel urged him to put the interest of the party first by breaking his silence. She went on to declare that the Kohl era was over and called on Christian Democrats to look ahead to a fresh political landscape. Kohl's allies reacted furiously accusing her of using her former patron's misfortunes to advance her own career - even claiming Merkel's letter provides prosecutors with the evidence they need to proceed against Kohl. Historian Arnulf Baring believes that Germany will soon reassess the former Chancellor's achievements. 'The news of the funding allegations marks the first step in taking stock of the Kohl era. With it, the Germans have put the illumination of the 'chancellor of unity' behind them,' he said. \u0095Denis Staunton writes for the Irish Times"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport3", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T18:40:52Z", "webTitle": "Big Mal's working lunch", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport3", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport3", "fields": {"bodyText": "Our lunch cannot go on too much longer. Malcolm Allison has to pick up his nine-year-old daughter from school. Hang on, you're thinking, isn't Allison into his seventies by now? That's right, 72 to be precise. So what's he doing with a daughter that young? Come on, you remember Big Mal. Just because he was into his sixties, that was no reason not to start a (third) family. At this time of retrospection, with the twentieth century just having ebbed to its close, an audience with Allison, a good player until struck down by tuberculosis and an outstanding coach, seemed a better way than most to cast a critical, autobiographical eye over more than half a century of English football. Allison signed as a professional with Charlton in 1945 and two years ago began working part-time as a scout for Arsenal, an appointment that ended a brief spell of idleness after he was sacked by local radio for splicing training-ground language into his comments on a Middlesbrough-Newcastle derby. His memories might lack a little precision, but at least they would be vivid, different and insightful. Perhaps London-boy Allison's most surprising feat, given his sybaritic past, is ending up happily married and living in Yarm in Cleveland - close to the parents of his third wife Lynn, who is 27 years his junior - on a neat, unpretentious housing estate. Moneywise, he is not the man he once was. His pension and Lynn's wages as a teacher keep them going. But his contentment is palpable and if the years have inevitably done some damage to his craggy good looks, they have left his twinkle-eyed wit and wisdom untouched. He limps a little from an arthritic ankle, but otherwise is fit. 'I went for a test 18 months ago,' he says. 'The doctor told me, \"You've got better lungs than anyone\".' Having part of his left lung removed in 1958 as a result of TB was what ended Allison's career as a central defender after he had played three First Division matches for Charlton and 255 League and Cup games for West Ham after signing for them in 1951. 'I couldn't understand it,' he says, 'I was a good trainer. I never drank, I never smoked. Then one day I was due to play in an evening match at Upton Park, I was walking down some stairs and collapsed. Then we went to Sheffield United to play an afternoon match and stayed overnight. Noel Cantwell, who shared a room with me, said to the manager the next day, \"I don't know what's wrong with Malcolm. He was coughing all night.\" They sent me to the hospital and the doctor said, \"What else can you do?\" I said, \"Not a lot.\" And he said, \"Well you're not going to play football any more\".' In fact, Allison could do something else, he could coach and train players. He had always been interested in this side of the game, sometimes to his detriment. He tells a wonderful story about when he was still a young reserve at Charlton, whose first team were full of internationals and had just won the FA Cup. He became disillusioned with Jimmy Trotter's training methods, which consisted mainly of running round the track and up and down the terracing. 'We were all standing there after one of these sessions,' he recalls, 'and I said, \"Mr Trotter, the training's effing rubbish.\" And all these players turned round, \"Who is this young upstart, like?\" I said, \"All we do is run around the track, up and down the terracing and play 11-a-side. We don't do anything.\" 'Next morning I had to go to see Jimmy Seed, the manager, and he said, \"Malcolm, you insulted Mr Trotter yesterday.\" I said, \"No I didn't, I just told him the training was rubbish.\" He said, \"You can't say that to Mr Trotter, and, anyway, I'm going to transfer you to West Ham United.\" So I said: \"Can I shake your hand, Mr Seed? I want to thank you for teaching me the art of communication, because you've just spoken to me for the third time in seven years\".' What really alerted Allison to the possibilities of coaching was Hungary's performance against England at Wembley in 1953. 'I went to the game with a player called Jimmy Andrews, a Scottish boy. As we were walking into the ground, the Hungarian team were warming up and Jimmy said to me, \"We'll murder these, Mal.\" I said, \"Why's that, Jim?\" He said, \"Look at that number ten over there, he's about a stone overweight\".' The No 10 was the legendary Ferenc Puskas - 'He did have a little tummy on him,' concedes Allison - who scored twice in the Hungarians' historic 6-3 win. 'What was absolutely amazing to me,' says Allison, 'was how the Hungarians, by changing positions, made such a difference. Herbert Chapman's W-M formation [the full-backs and half-backs arranged in a W and the five forwards in an M] lasted for more than 25 years. Everyone copied this formation, so when the Hungarians changed their tactics and played with a deep centre-forward, they destroyed England. Okay, they might have had some great players, but they weren't that much better than us, not 6-3 and 7-1 [Hungary's margin of victory a year later in Budapest] better.' Allison believes the match had not only a profound effect on him, but also on one Alf Ramsey, to the extent that it laid the foundation for English football's finest hour. 'Ramsey was at right back [at Wembley] and nearly all their goals came down that side,' says Allison. 'He couldn't handle the winger, who was too quick for him. So when Ramsey became England manager, he adopted the two deep wingers to protect the full-backs so they couldn't get chased like he had been. He developed this 4-4-2 formation, which won the 1966 World Cup. It got me thinking, too, that it was more about formations, about the way you played, than about great players.' Allison's restless nature meant that throughout his long career as a coach and manager he never stayed at one club for long, apart from his eight-year first stint at Manchester City as assistant to Joe Mercer and then as manager. At City, he proved conclusively that he had exceptional gifts as a coach and motivator. Under Old Trafford's envious gaze, he helped to quide City to the First (1967-68) and Second (1965-66) Division championships, the FA Cup (1969), the League Cup (1970) and the European Cup Winners' Cup (1970). He says his most pleasing result ever was the 3-1 win at Old Trafford as City closed in on the 1968 League title. United were then champions and would, in a few weeks, lift the European Cup with their memorable 4-1 victory over Benfica. And he tells of a previously undisclosed piece of typical Allison mischief: 'Nobody knows this, but the night before the match I had the flag on top of the stand at Old Trafford pulled down to half-mast. I got a steeplejack to put a ladder up the side of the building and he pulled it down to half-mast. And you know, no one noticed until a few days afterwards.' Allison went back to Maine Road in 1979 with disastrous results. 'The first time, because they were doing so badly, everything I asked them to do they did. They didn't argue. When I went the second time there were lots of successful players, but they didn't want to work. They didn't want to train and they moaned and they dodged. They were non-professional.' Many thought his predilection for showmanship was a distraction that affected Allison's record as a manager, although in 1976 , during his most flamboyant spell - when his preposterous fedora hat became a feature of English grounds - he achieved one of his most memorable feats, taking Third Division Crystal Palace to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. 'I knew about this fellow called Jack Tinn, the Portsmouth manager in 1939 who wore spats. When he was asked why he wore them, he said, \"We're going to win the Cup with these spats.\" I think they were 40-1 and they went and won it. So I thought, \"Well, nobody can really see spats, so I'm going to wear the fedora\".' Palace beat Leeds, Chelsea and Sunderland in successive away matches in that Cup run, but it was an incident after their third-round victory at Scarborough that convinced Allison of the effectiveness of his outlandish headgear. 'As I was going past their dressing room, all their players were in the bath and I could hear them saying, \"What do you think about that big-headed bastard. First chance we ever have of getting some publicity and he comes along in that stupid hat\".' Allison is characteristically uncompromising on the subject of modern coaching. 'It's very disappointing,' he says. 'I mean that Charles Hughes [the Football Association's former director of coaching] knocked us back a hundred years. How the FA can run our football is ridiculous. There's nobody there who's been in football. I mean all the people who ever achieved anything in the game - people like Brian Clough and Jack Charlton - never got a job at the FA.' He says that modern British players - Tony Adams is 'probably the best centre-half I've ever seen', and Michael Owen, 'not only is he like lightning, but he's technically very, very good' - have to rely on the influence of foreign stars they play with and see on television to raise the standard of their games. He also thinks that schools are failing to develop the very young, and reckons he is in possession of some pretty convincing evidence. 'Who teaches the kids at school?' he asks. 'I'll tell you who teaches them. In 90 per cent of the schools, the women teach them. Now, I haven't got anything against women, I like them.

As the last century dawned, England already had a successful league structure, but many of today's biggest clubs didn't even exist: while Barcelona and Milan were newly founded, Real Madrid, Lazio and Inter were still pipe-dreams. In Argentina the first club arrived in the 1880s, but in Brazil they had to wait until 1905; in England Newton Heath were still two years away from renaming themselves Manchester United. The 1899-1900 season in England ended with Aston Villa winning the league title for the fifth time in seven years. They were captained by John Davey, a strong and skilful inside-right who first played for Villa at baseball before becoming a mainstay of their gloriously successful side of the 1890s. On new year's eve he was three months short of his fortieth birthday, and the league was to be his last major honour. Villa's Bill Garraty was the league's top scorer in the first season of the new century, with 27. They weren't so strong in the cups, though, and made an early exit from the 1899-1900 FA Cup at the hands of Southern League minnows Millwall. Still, they finished two points clear of Sheffield United at the top thanks to five wins in their last six games. Bottom of the league that year were Glossop North End, nine points adrift of Burnley, who were also relegated. Newton Heath and Arsenal were both Second Division sides. The top striker of the day was Derby County's Steve Bloomer, league top scorer in 1896, 97, 99, 1901 and 1904. He remains the club's record goalscorer, having notched 292 times in the league, 238 times in the FA Cup and once in a Test Match during his two spells at the club. In Scotland, the first league title of the new century went to Rangers. Between them, Celtic and Rangers won all but two league titles between 1898 and 1932.

The American players - including Mia Hamm, owner of the sixth most popular football internet site in the world (behind David Beckham, Michael Owen, Filippo Inzaghi, Alessandro Del Piero and Rivaldo) - have also threatened to pull out of two other exhibition matches in February in protest against the US Soccer Federation failing to give them new, long-term contracts. This latest disruption is the third major dispute between the USSF and the team. Four years ago they staged a training camp walk-out in a protest over bonuses, and last summer brokered their own deal to play in a nationwide tour rather than attend the federation's official event. They eventually reached a compromise which earned each player \u00a362,000. Now, says lawyer John Langel, the players want a long-term deal at \u00a33,100 a month, plus \u00a31,200 a game - not the \u00a32,000 a month currently on the table. 'They have essentially ignored our successes over the last three years,' says captain Carla Overbeck, 'and are asking us to do the same.' The decimated squad - still without a manager after Tony DiCicco quit in November - will set off today for matches against the Czech Republic, Sweden and Australia, made up almost entirely of inexperienced college girls, plus three high-school players. America's infatuation with the beautiful game, it seems, could prove unexpectedly brief. Love trysts: Don't do it, girls Women who have sex with footballers are being warned that they risk catching arthritis. The New Scientist report into sexually acquired reactive arthritis (SARA), warned last week that the disease, triggered by a sexually transmitted bacterial infection, could leave a generation of soccer groupies 'going weak at the knees on a more permanent basis'. Reproduced in Zest magazine, the study of professional sportsmen with persistent knee injuries - including five unnamed Premiership players - found that their promiscuous lifestyles were to blame. Paul Oyudo, who carried out the study at Queen Mary and Westfield College in London, said sleeping around was the key common factor. 'The level of promiscuity among these sportsmen calls for concern. Footballers appear to be the greatest culprits.' On average, each of the five footballers had spent eight months struggling with their injury before being diagnosed with SARA. But Zest remains more concerned about the possible consequences for star struck young ladies. 'Check his knees and ankles before leaving the club, girls.' Simply the best? 'The Gunners are the greatest!' claimed Arsenal's matchday programme last week - referring to the Independent's statistical study showing them to be 'officially the team of the century'. The table was based on league positions since 1900. 'The commodity the Gunners have possessed over the course of the century, that their rivals have not,' glowed the programme, 'has been consistency'. The picture was different, though, in the Daily Telegraph : 'Liverpool beat Arsenal to team of the century title'. Their table was constructed by accumulating points for all games played from 1900 to 1999. So what's the truth? According to the wider picture - adjusting points totals to reduce the impact of the latter-day three points for a win and covering the entirety of the League since its inception in 1888 - the top team is, in fact ,Everton. Their record - played 3758, won 1545, drawn 917 and lost 1296 - beats their rivals hands down. But there is one crumb of comfort for the red half of Merseyside: if Everton lose to Leicester tomorrow and Liverpool beat Spurs, they will close the gap to 99 points. Emmanuel: 21st century socks Another week, another dozen footballers launch dreadful personal websites. Among the latest batch is Emmanuel Petit's own domain - www.emmanuelpetit.com . Featuring personalised match reports and asides ('John Hartson came 'to look for trouble' several times until I decided to tell him how I felt'), the site focuses chiefly on Emmanuel's taste for fashion. 'In my youth, my only passion was fashion. As soon as I earned a little money, a few pennies at a time, I bought gear. I've been filled with that since I was thirteen years old.' Not only that, but, admits Emmanuel, 'I've been fascinated by leather for a very long time.' Less oblique is Erland Johnsen's new site, dedicated to showcasing what the former Chelsea man calls 'my good jokes'. There is, in fact, only one - Johnsen has designed a game enabling visitors to 'throw' Rosenborg star John Ivar 'Mini' Jakobsen face down onto a virtual pitch. Johnsen, currently playing for Stromsgodset, claims to have launched 'Throw Mini' after becoming increasingly tired of Jakobsen's big mouth.

Tony Ford shrugs and grins. How many other players who are mocked, albeit good-naturedly, by fans end up with a call from the Palace and an MBE? He actually quite likes the song the Rochdale supporters affectionately chant in his honour. 'I don't know where they get the big and the bad from but I can't complain about the old, can I?' Not really. Not when he is the only 40-year-old still pulling on his boots and holding down an outfield position in league football. Neville Southall, as Ford points out, is slightly older, but goalkeepers are special cases, and as a late starter, the former Everton and Wales hero has only 19 seasons in the bag to the Rochdale player's 25. Southall will be lucky to top 700 league appearances whereas Ford, who began as a 16-year-old at Grimsby a quarter of a century ago, is already a record breaker on 856. Outfield player just about covers Ford's present role too, for though he has appeared in every position on the field bar goalkeeper for significant lengths of time (with the exception of centre-half, which was strictly an emer gency), he is now back where he started on the right of midfield. 'You can say I play wide right,' he said. 'I haven't got the pace any more to call myself a winger, and if I described myself as a wing-back I'd never hear the end of it from the lads. I just play on the right.' Ford spent 11 seasons with his native Grimsby, helping them rise to the old second division before moving on to Stoke and West Bromwich Albion, before another spell with the Mariners. Scunthorpe and Mansfield were his two other principal ports of call, and when his old Stoke ally Steve Parkin moved from Field Mill to take over as manager at Rochdale, Ford was not too surprised to get an offer to follow. 'The surprise had come a couple of seasons earlier,' he said. 'I thought my playing days had finished at 37, when I left Scunthorpe. I joined Barrow to keep fit but I had dropped out of the league, I thought that was it. When Steve persuaded me to go to Mansfield it was as youth team coach. Then when I had been there a while he asked me if I would consider making a comeback, and that's what I'm doing here. I'm still coming back.' He might not have arrived at Spotland had Mansfield looked favourably on his application to become manager - 'It's not as if I've never tried to stop playing' - but they turned him down. 'It's their loss,' Ford said. With Rochdale well in contention for the play-offs Ford is glad he folowed Parkin. There is no secret to his longevity, just an aptitude for training and an appetite for the game. 'I've never smoked, but I can't pretend I don't like the odd drinking binge,' he said. 'Players do look after themselves far better now, we know more about what not to do. Look at Stuart Pearce, back in the England squad recently for goodness sake.' By Ford's reckoning he has played under 14 managers, but the first, Tommy Casey at Grimsby, probably made the biggest impression. 'He was a bit old-fashioned, very big on discipline but also big on fitness, and he used to instil into each of us the need for aggression in football. He brought a lot out of us, and I still remember a lot of what he taught me.' Ford has no regrets, apart from the obvious one of not being born a dozen or so years later. Not that he is bitter about the stupendous salaries currently washing around the Premiership, which never trickled down to any of his clubs. 'I missed out on the big money, but so did Stanley Matthews,' he said. 'But I 've made a good living out of the game so I'm not complaining. I daresay a lot of today's players won't fancy carrying on until they are 40 though, not when they are set up for life before they are half way through their careers.' Ford, as surprised as he was delighted with his MBE, believes there would be more older players about, in the lower leagues at least, were it not for ageism. 'Quite a few players are discouraged by the lack of interest shown in them once they reach a certain age. It takes a brave manager to bring in someone who might have more experience than him, someone who could present a threat to his way of doing things. I've nothing against bringing kids in but young players need people to learn from.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "film/2000/jan/02/francoistruffaut.worldcinema", "type": "article", "sectionId": "film", "sectionName": "Film", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T19:37:28Z", "webTitle": "Belle de nos jours", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/02/francoistruffaut.worldcinema", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/film/2000/jan/02/francoistruffaut.worldcinema", "fields": {"bodyText": "She is, the director Claude Chabrol once said, 'the only Hitchcockian heroine in France'. Catherine Deneuve never worked with Hitchcock, but for a time, in the Sixties, and under the direction of others - Polanski, Bu\u00f1uel, Jacques Demy - she epitomised the cool, enigmatic blonde. In an essay which might easily be applied to Deneuve, Hitchcock explained the rationale behind his casting: 'It is important to distinguish between the big, bosomy blonde and the ladylike blonde with the touch of elegance, whose sex must be discovered,' he wrote. 'On the screen, for example, if an actress wants to convey a sexy quality, she ought to maintain a slightly mysterious air. When a man approaches her, the audience should be led to wonder whether she intends to shrink from him or tear off his clothes.' Deneuve had a Hitchcockian pedigree: she was more Grace Kelly, more Kim Novak or Eva Marie Saint than Brigitte Bardot. But Deneuve moved the coolness up a notch: in Repulsion she plays a hysteric disgusted by sex, in Belle de Jour she is a frigid wife who finds an outlet in prostitution - it was as if all that blonde mystery finally came together in her immovable, mask-like face. Truffaut spoke about her 'dream element': in these roles she was blank, pure, sexually unfinished; she became a screen on to which any fantasy could be projected. Deneuve has moved on since then. She is now in her late fifties, and has aged with a grace that would doubtless be unimaginable to the beribboned young girl she played in the Umbrellas of Cherbourg . When I meet her in the bar of a hotel near her home in Paris, she is dressed casually and behaves calmly. She wears tinted glasses, smokes slim white cigarettes, which she takes from a silver case, and speaks in a low, rippling voice - so fast that, as she once admitted, she has even had trouble dubbing herself. This week, Deneuve can be seen in British cinemas in Time Regained , Raoul Ruiz's adaptation of Proust. She plays Odette, the coquettish, charming mother of the girl Marcel loves. Her role is brief, but she carries it with intelligence and grace. When I mention this, Deneuve looks worried, and doesn't take grace as a compliment ('Really? You think it wasn't frivolous enough?'), but it's a mark of how far she's come, and of the kind of roles she has eased into maturely. Though she has worked more or less constantly (this year alone, we can also expect to see her in L\u00e9os Carax's Pola X , R\u00e9gis Wargnier's East-West, and Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark ), the Seventies were not a smooth ride, and by the early Eighties French critics were damning her clunky passage from doll-like fantasy-figure to who knew what? You could say that she had trouble, on screen, becoming a woman. But by the time she starred in Wargnier's Indochine (1991), for which she was nominated for an Oscar, the coolness was gone. She played a mother, and a lover, driven both by sexual desire and overwhelming motherly love. The two emotions clash, tragically, and Deneuve retains her elegance and strength while revealing a crumbling vulnerability and a raw warmth. How did this change come about? 'The first person who offered me a mature role was Truffaut, with The Last Metro [in 1980]. He said he was going to give me the role of a woman who was not unattractive, but who had a responsible part in a film, with more to do than just fall in love. So it was in the Eighties that it started.' Andre T\u00e9chin\u00e9 also helped her 'to evolve - not in myself, I mean, but in relation to the audience - by offering me roles of women who were more complex than what you generally find in the cinema'. Deneuve has made three films with T\u00e9chin\u00e9 - Scene of the Crime (1986), My Favourite Season (1993), and Les Voleurs (1996). They introduced her to a naturalism, a kind of rough-edged emotion, which she hadn't previously encountered. She wasn't afraid of the change: 'I was perceived as this sophisticated actress, and T\u00e9chin\u00e9 really unveiled me, if you like, with the parts he wrote for me, in the way he directed me, the way he filmed me - I became someone more vulnerable, closer to a modern woman than to a mythical figure'. She could not have made the shift on her own, she explains, because 'in France, all directors are auteurs so you can't propose projects to them, because they work on their own subjects'. I suggest that if you watch Belle de Jour or Repulsion now, they come across as Catherine Deneuve films. They are united by her, and it's tempting to say that, over time, she has become the auteur of those movies. 'It's true that that happens, though not always, after a very, very long time.' But she explains that when she first worked with Bu\u00f1uel she had no idea what he wanted from her. ' Belle de Jour was very difficult, because it's a film about fantasies, so everything is very masked - more is unsaid than is said. I was very resistant to it initially. I thought he wanted to do something cruder, more naked. It wasn't a lack of confidence in him that made me resistant, but my own prudishness and anxiety. His relationships with his actresses were - well, he could never be really intimate with women, he was a very tormented man, and he didn't speak to his actors much. But it finished up well enough for us to work together again less than two years later.' The later film, Tristana, is the one Deneuve prefers of the two. She plays the title role, a young woman who develops a sexual relationship with her legal guardian and later wreaks her revenge on him - though not before having a leg amputated. (The only time Hitchcock met Bu\u00f1uel, he patted him on the back and said, admiringly, 'Bu\u00f1uel. That wooden leg'.) At one point in Tristana , Deneuve's character stands on a balcony and opens her dressing gown, revealing her body to a boy below. The audience sees only her face. Slowly, strangely, she smiles. 'Yes, I like that scene a lot,' Deneuve remembers. 'I decided to smile, because when I knew how it was framed I wanted to show what you couldn't see. She knows the boy can see her breasts, but also her amputated leg, so it's a way of saying, I know what you're looking at, and I know how I am - a way of having the upper hand despite everything. I always like things that have a double edge.' Deneuve has long been, in her phrase, a 'mythical figure', and not just on screen. When she made Belle de Jour in 1967, Yves Saint Laurent designed the costumes. From then on she became his friend and muse. In 1965 she married David Bailey, who took some wonderful photographs of her - she became an icon, a still. In the Seventies she was the face of Chanel, and in 1985 she was chosen as the face of Marianne, the symbol of the French republic, to be sculpted for exhibition in town halls and to be silhouetted on stamps. But while she was, externally, the image of perfection, the turbulence of her private life always spilt out into the public domain. At 17 she met Roger Vadim - the man who 'discovered' Bardot - and had a child with him. In 1972 she had a daughter with Marcello Mastroianni (Chiara Mastroianni now has a blooming acting career of her own, and also figures in Time Regained ). Deneuve has always tried to keep her privacy. 'We all have a right to our secret garden,' she says. But there is one very personal subject I wanted to ask her about. In 1967, Deneuve and her sister, Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac, played twins in Les Demoiselles de Rochefort , a musical by Jacques Demy. That year, on her way back from a holiday in the south of France, Dorl\u00e9ac died in a car crash. Truffaut, who had directed her in La Peau Douce , wrote in Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma : 'It is unacceptable that on 26 June last year, that great cascading laughter was cut short.' She was a year older than Deneuve, and began her acting career earlier. She was serious about it, and had acted on stage. It was only when she was in a film for which an actress had to be found to play her sister that she persuaded Deneuve to audition. From then on, their careers moved in tandem: Deneuve made Repulsion with Polanski, Dorl\u00e9ac starred in his Cul de Sac the following year; both worked with Truffaut, both worked with Demy. But the two couldn't have been more different. Deneuve's reserve was more than matched by Dorl\u00e9ac's joie de vivre. Deneuve envied the mobility of her sister's face; Dorl\u00e9ac, less physically perfect, had a complex about being 'asymmetrical'. They grew up in a liberal family with two younger sisters. Their father was head of dubbing at Paramount, and their mother, whose maiden name Deneuve later adopted, had been a child actor. Until Deneuve left home to live with Vadim, the two girls shared a bunk bed. They were very, very close. In 1996 Deneuve put together a documentary about her sister and a book was published to accompany the film. It was the first time she had been able to speak about her sister since her death, and, she said then, she didn't know if there would be a second time. But now, when I ask, tentatively, about Dorl\u00e9ac, she tells me she is constantly surprised by how vividly Fran\u00e7oise is remembered and by how many admirers she has amongst those who weren't even born when she died - people of my generation. I ask her what she makes of the comment published in an issue of Positif from the Eighties, which offered her this career advice: 'Deneuve lacks an energy, a spikiness, an acidity which she might have borrowed from her sister Fran\u00e7oise Dorl\u00e9ac.' 'That's an extremely curious thing to say,' she replies, 'I think it's incredibly incongruous, and incredibly tactless. I think it's totally out of place, and I don't think it means anything. It's like blaming a blonde for being blonde.' Though clearly shocked, Deneuve keeps talking. 'Every time someone says something like that it hurts me because it awakens something - we were so complementary, and I feel something is missing from me. You know, when you're with happy people you feel happy. So it's true that I lack something which to some extent she helped me to be. But, as Giscard d'Estaing said about Mitterrand, he's him and I'm me. That's right. It's difficult enough to be oneself, without having to be thrown back to someone else.' She pauses. 'But now I can accept that kind of comment a bit better, because I've gone back over everything that links me to her. It's less painful than it was. Because it was painful for a very, very, very long time.' I want to know more about Dorl\u00e9ac, but I feel sorry for broaching so intimate a subject. Throughout our conversation, Deneuve has been cordial, then congenial, at times almost motherly, and now vulnerable. She said at one point that she thought some articles about actors would be better written without speaking to the actor in question, but there is much more to admire in Deneuve on meeting her. There is just little point in trying to sum her up. I remember something she said when we were talking about her latest character, Odette: 'I don't feel what you see. I feel a woman who seems to be in control, seems to speak that way of her life and yet she is a frivolous, fragile woman. Or at least she is to me.'

Three days after closing on Broadway in his acclaimed revival of Eugene O'Neill's four and a half hour marathon The Iceman Cometh, he bounces into one of his favourite Los Angeles haunts, a restaurant on Sunset Boulevard he would rather remained nameless, a place to meet and greet and hang out, where the waitresses know him by his first name and he enjoys them well enough to be inclined to joke and flirt. 'Make me one of those iced, swirly, frothy frappuccino mocha things,' he says to a young woman dressed modishly in black. 'What? What? Why do I make you laugh so much?' he says in a soft, deadpan voice, because she does, indeed, seem to be giggling, helplessly. 'Am I so funny?' This is not at all the Spacey we know from his various screen personae: the creepy, criminal mastermind Keyser Soze masquerading as a whining gimp in The Usual Suspects (a turn for which he won an Oscar in 1995), the demented serial killer who outwits both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman (two guys who usually never lose) in Seven, the bitter loser squabbling and sniping with Judy Davis in The Ref, or supercilious, faggy murderer Jim Williams in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. In the flesh, Spacey is much more high-energy and high-spirited and odd. He is wearing sharp black trousers and a crisp, white, button-down shirt with a Pentel pen in the pocket. With his round, almost anonymous face, he looks both bland and groomed, like an accountant about to take a vacation, except for the black baseball cap that says 'NYU Film'. Which is to say that Spacey does not at first strike you as an actor at all - a considerable irony, because he is the consummate actor of his generation, an actor right down to the fibre of his no doubt immaculate cotton socks. He moves with Japanese neatness and almost feline delicacy. He has a scar above the lid of his left eye, the result of an altercation with a cat named Prince Albert when he was growing up just over the hill from here, in the San Fernando Valley. Spacey takes gum from his mouth, places it with exquisite deliberation in the centre of a spotless white ashtray and eagerly hits the mark about his new movie American Beauty, co-starring Annette Bening and directed by first-timer Sam Mendes (the young English director whose work for the stage includes the recent London and New York runs of Cabaret and The Blue Room ). American Beauty is the buzz film, having been described by Steven Spielberg as the best thing he has seen in years, and a reminder of why he himself wants to make movies - giddy praise indeed, even if Spielberg's Dreamworks company did produce the picture. In talking about American Beauty, for once it is right to use superlatives. This film is howlingly funny, but not a comedy. It ends tragically, yet reminds us of the beauty of life. It centres on the disintegration and renaissance of an executive, Lester Burnham (Spacey), and his relationship with his wife (Bening, who lets rip in ways both hilarious and terrifying). Although Lester whacks off in the shower, lusts and drools over his daughter's sultry best friend and blackmails his boss when he is fired, the film concerns itself as much with suburban morality and teenage angst as it does with the male menopause. American Beauty will, I think, quickly find itself in the category of masterpieces such as The Graduate, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Ordinary People. It is emotionally spacious, perfectly modulated and seems likely to redefine Spacey's career and kick it on to another level. 'Kevin has been pigeonholed as a Machiavelli, the cleverest man on screen,' says Mendes. 'Here he plays a man who's blind to the world and outrageous and foolish and charming by turn. This is a very different part for him because audiences can love his character while being shocked by what he does. I think Kevin realised right from the start how big a moment this would be in his career if it worked.' In the restaurant, Spacey removes his baseball cap, revealing thinning black hair. At 39, he conducts himself with the relaxed confidence of a man quite aware of the fact that he's really hitting his stride these days. 'People tend to want you the way they discovered you, and I got dissolved in very dark parts. It's been the greatest thing in the world to me when I've heard people say about American Beauty, \"I never thought he could do this.\" Well, I can do it and I've been trying to tell people for years.' He first read TV comedy writer Alan Ball's screenplay in the summer of 1998, when he was still playing in Iceman in London. 'I knew that it was sensational, ahead of its time on so many levels that are relevant to the world we find ourselves in as we walk into the millennium. To me, the whole film is about perception and how easy it is to misperceive or to perceive only what you care to perceive. People ask, \"How does a thing like Columbine, Colorado, happen?\" I think this movie answers that question. It's right there in front of us. There are usually unnoticed goings- on between families and neighbours and co-workers that are subterranean truths once you examine them.' At which point Spacey, examining me examining his tongue nervously fretting at his lip, excuses himself and bolts out to his car to apply something to an area that, he tells me, got burned windsailing. Keyser Soze windsailing? Kevin Spacey, the Valley boy turned Julliard graduate and archetypal New York theatre figure windsailing? It does not seem to fit, but then for years journalists have been trying to work out who Spacey really is. There's the mysterious issue of his real name, for instance - Kevin Fowler. Where does the Spacey come from? He is not letting on, and Internet speculation is rife. The game took an unpleasant turn a couple of years back when a magazine article centred itself on another rumour, that Spacey is gay. He bounds back up the stairs from the car park and sits again, lip duly salved. I ask what impact the piece had had on him and his career. He accepts the question graciously but becomes animated, leaning back in his chair and waving his arms, as though the memory - whatever he may say to the contrary - stings. 'It didn't impact on me at all. It had nothing to do with me. People say they're appalled about my private life being dragged through the pages of a magazine. I was laughing with Ed Norton about this recently, because my private life wasn't put out there at all. My private life was intact. That was just presumption, rumour, based on nothing. 'If you come to me and say, I hear you're a bigot, I hear you're a paedophile, I hear you cheat on your taxes, you bet your ass I'd stand up and defend myself because those are things I don't want to be associated with and I find reprehensible. But what's wrong with gay people? Why should I be pressed to stand up and say I'm not one of them?' Spacey may choose not to take journalists on a personal journey of his experience, but when you meet him, he is much funnier and more intimate than expected. After acting in high school, and while he was at Julliard, he began his professional career as a stand-up comedian, doing impressions. During the lunch, chatting away, picking at the salmon he has ordered from the still giggling waitress, his voice takes on the tones of some of those he has admired or met or worked with. In front of my eyes, he becomes Johnny Carson, Katharine Hepburn, John Gielgud, Danny DeVito, Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. These last two have become his career guides, as well as close friends. He still has the photograph Lemmon signed for him as a child, and it was Pacino who gave him his first big break in the movies in Glengarry Glenross and later invited him to be his co-conspirator in the Shakespeare documentary Looking for Richard. Spacey both acted in the film and tagged along for the ride, sitting off camera while Pacino conducted his interviews with scores of noted academics, directors and actors. Now he speaks of both Lemmon and Pacino with a humour and warmth that borders on veneration, giving a glimpse of the Spacey who once was, and to some extent still is, the nerdiest of theatre fans. It occurs to me, putting aside all consideration of who he is as a private indi vidual, that this is who Kevin Spacey is becoming as an actor - a shotgun marriage of two great performers and stars who seem, on the face of it, improbable bedfellows - Jack Lemmon and Al Pacino. 'He's a strategist as an actor and, like Lemmon, he doesn't look like a film star,' agrees Mendes. 'While we were shooting American Beauty , we talked a lot about The Apartment and the way Lemmon made that character so real and normal, right down to the way his hair changed through the course of the movie - becoming both more and more distressed and yet more and more true to his inner self. Kevin's concentration is like a laser beam. And like Pacino, you always feel certain he's going to find those moments that will make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.' Spacey has worked extremely hard during these past two years, turning his career in this new direction that seems to fit so well. In between productions of Iceman in London and New York (where he lives with his dog in a small Greenwich Village apartment), he shot three movies back to back - American Beauty, Ordinary Decent Criminal , based on the life of Irish gangster Martin Cahill, and The Big Kahuna , produced by his own Trigger Street Productions, a $2 million movie about two salesmen, in which he stars with a pal from LA Confidential, Danny DeVito. He has his own company to do low-budget films that will both bolster his credibility and keep him topped up with a supply of good parts should the studio well run dry. He is already talking about a screen version of Iceman, and foresees a small run of films based on plays, because the material is to hand and he sees a ready way into it. 'I'm just as susceptible as anybody to the things that pull and tempt you,' Spacey says. 'You have to seek out those things both in terms of people and material that are sincere and driven by a similar sensibility to your own. Pretty obviously I'm not only interested in making lots of dough and being famous. As far as Hollywood goes, I don't want to contribute to the problem, whatever I perceive the problem to be.' What does he perceive the problem to be? 'Oh, it's massive. It's massive and it's ugly,' he says with a big grin, too smart, too damned relaxed to be drawn into a harangue about the ills of the movie industry. He's at a happy place in his career and, besides, he is about to go on vacation. So Kevin Spacey calls over the waitress and asks for another iced, swirly mocha thing. What they said... what he did 'One of the year's finest pictures... by turns hilarious, painful and brutally frank. Kevin Spacey practically glows with vulnerability. His portrayal of the beleaguered suburban male of the species is achingly tender.' Washington Post 'Unsettling, unnerving, undefinable, American Beauty is a blood-chilling dark comedy, a strange, brooding and very accomplished film. Kevin Spacey is superb as Lester, whose wife and daughter consider him \"this gigantic loser\". There definitely is a hell of a picture here.' Los Angeles Times ' American Beauty is a triumph - adult, smart, involving, stylish. Spacey powers the movie, not only sympathetic as the rebellious suburbanite but also very vulnerable.' New York Times A Bug's Life (1998) Spacey voices Hopper, the nasty, one-eyed leader of the grasshoppers. The Negotiator (1998) Spacey plays the Chicago police force's toughest negotiator, Chris Sabian. Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil (1997) Spacey plays Jim Williams, a rich, Gatsbyesque mystery man on trial for murdering his male lover. L.A.

The boy's crime had been to leap up with delight as Tim Sherwood scored at Villa Park on Wednesday night and the volley of foul language he received from a home supporter terrified him into tears. The Aston Villa steward did his best to find the boy and his father other seats among the many decent local people around him but by now, half-time, he just wanted to go home. Some Christmas present, a trip to a Premiership game. Welcome to the reality of verbal violence mostly masked by the gloss and glamour that comes through a television screen. Hooliganism may all but have departed stadiums, driven out by the emergence of closed circuit TV to edge-of-town locations for organised bundles, but so grateful are we for the general lack of physical aggro that it seems we will tolerate pretty much any form of anti-social behaviour as long as we escape unhurt. The result is an often unpleasant experience where exhibitionist displays of sewer-mouthed laddishness at best embarrass sons and their fathers, at worst cause them to leave and re-consider returning. The worst elements among the modern English fan are assuming an arrogance and power that is damaging the game's well-being by driving out the right-minded. This season the chants directed at David Beckham, Alan Shearer, David Ginola et al have become more vicious and bilious, given credence by their publication in football magazines rapdily going downmarket in an attempt to prise beer money out of the lads. The right to shout and criticise comes with the admission money, naturally; the right to eff and blind should not. Then at St James' Park recently, some fans apparently took exception to Ginola responding to abuse with a gesture and reported him to police. It is remarkable how people dishing it out suddenly become so easily shrinking-violet shockable. What recourse is open to Ginola? We may not be far from a player pressing charges against a fan. Not that things are too much better at White Hart Lane, it should be said. In common with the other London grounds, it can be a cockpit of hate. My nine-year-old son is a Tottenham supporter but you find yourself picking and choosing games. Such as Manchester United and Arsenal are going to be filled and fuelled with resentment and the angry faces and mouthes intimidate him. Once, buying a seat meant you would not encounter the excesses. If it offended you in the standing areas, you simply walked to another spot. In these all-seated days, there is little chance of escape. The leery climate is just so widespread. Imagine buying your season ticket and turning up on opening day to find that the bloke next to you is a bigot with a big gob. It must be the same feeling as getting on a train at Newcastle and finding that the only seat left is in the middle of a group of away supporters from London. Gone, it sometimes seems, is the wit that once enhanced the watching experience. These are brasher, less respectful days with a backlash of envy at players who earn lottery jackpots then don't deliver. Egged on by voracious media, certain fans, and groups of them, have assumed as a result a self-importance above their station. A week ago, for example, a representative of some 'independent' Spurs supporters organisation was calling for those who travelled to see the 6-1 defeat at Newcastle to be re-imbursed due to the ineptitude of the team. Surely fans accept that such an outcome is part of the spontaneous possibility of following a club? Should Tottenham then have imposed a levy for the 4-0 win over Watford a few days later? It was an example of how too much importance is attached to knee-jerk, ill-informed comment from minority interests now. The Football Supporters' Association, for example, barely represent one in 100 fans, but are constantly quoted. The much bigger National Federation of Supporters' Clubs are rarely heard from because they are more moderate. Radio phone-ins, a huge growth industry over the instant-gratification last decade, feed and rely on it. On a car journey back from, say Birmingham, after a game, you can be shaking your head from Sparkbrook to Scratchwood, with perhaps just a nod of agreement near Northampton. One solution is for constructive, rational people to pick up the phone for a change. And what of solutions within grounds? One, at the very least, must be to enforce those signs warning about people using foul language being ejected rather than simply paying lip-service to them. It falls also to us to support the brave, decent man who confronts a lout. Otherwise the horrendous snarling image of the Englishman abroad will prevail - and it is noticable probably only in some Germans among other nations at major tournaments- and the country will deservedly lose the chance to host a World Cup. Lose a generation of kids who actually attend, too, as the issue of what they might be subjected to, rather than the cost of going to a game, is most pressing for a parent. Instead, they will simply watch on TV. And while that may sound fine for the merchants of sbscription, in the long-term TV will not want a backdrop of empty seats. Football ignores at its peril any symptom of the falling gates we have seen this season, remembering that bust has followed boom before. It has done much to clean up on the field. For our kids' sakes, it is time to clean up off it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/02/sport.comment1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T19:55:06Z", "webTitle": "Team Britain emerges", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/02/sport.comment1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/02/sport.comment1", "fields": {"bodyText": "Dennis Wise, the Manchester United manager, was quite right the other night on Ian Wright at the London Palladium - the amazing thing about football is not that it has changed so much but that it has changed so little. A time traveller from the last century would have no difficulty recognising the same 11-a-side game with its overworked referee and extraordinarily irksome offside law. There was a brief clamour to reduce the number of players in a team just because rugby union had done the same, but a pan-European panel of chairmen quickly decided there were already enough players earning a million pounds a week turning out for the stiffs, and the idea of discussing compulsory redundancies with the world's richest and most powerful trade union was too frightening to contemplate. In any case, people like 11-a-side football. There is no problem with overcrowding on the pitch, as there had been in rugby. The whole world plays football, even China and Australia these days, although British Isles manager Gary Lineker would doubtless prefer to see fewer Pacific rim players plying their trade in the Foster's Premiership. People like just having one referee, too, or at least they now accept, after the great doubling up disaster of the 2004-05 season, that a single official might be the least troublesome compromise. Fifa's three-year experiment with two referees was scrapped after just one season due to widespread and wholly unprecedented outbreaks of fighting between officials. Football certainly expanded its audience in that season, and it was fun to knock WWF wrestling off the top of the American ratings for a while, but the authorities eventually decided twin referees were bringing the game into disrepute. It wasn't the snarling, the spitting or the continual bickering that exhausted everyone's patience, the refs pushed their luck too far with theatrical costumes and silly names like Terminator and Timelord. Men In Black agent Eric Hall always denied it, but the referees were claiming too much attention. The game has settled back down now with just one man in the middle, using the name his mother gave him, regulation issue shorts and a whistle instead of a thunderclap. He does have three additional helpers in the form of an independent timekeeper and two penalty-box scrutineers, but communication between officials is strictly limited to radio headsets. So at least the game looks the same from the stands as it did in the twentieth century, assuming you have brought your telescope. For despite constant concern over the last 20 years that football's bubble would burst, the game has never been bigger. More people than ever before watch Premiership football, which is remarkable considering there are now just 16 clubs and only eight games per weekend. But each of those eight games plays to absolute capacity, and it is over four years since any Premiership ground attracted an audience of under 100,000. Of the mainland's other 20 professional clubs in the Fuji League, only Blackburn Rovers regularly play to crowds under 50,000. When you consider that as recently as nine or 10 years ago clubs like Southampton and Wimbledon were still in business, if that is not too grand a term for teams watched by fewer than 20,000, the speed of change in the past decade is clear to see. The catalyst, of course, was Fifa's decision in 2000 to award the 2006 World Cup to these islands on condition the five home football associations amalgamated into one. Traditionalists did not like it, but it was clear from England's appalling showing at the 2002 European Championship in Belgium and Holland that there was little point in countries who can't even find a decent left winger trying to stand alone. Ryan Giggs played in his first World Cup in 2006 after helping the British Isles to qualify for a tournament dubbed 'Football Comes Home' and there was never any going back once Robbie Keane topped the goals chart as Sir Alex Ferguson's boys triumphed. In the same year the Premiership shrank to its present format, with Southampton taking their franchise to Dublin to become the Irish Saints, very much the success story of the past couple of seasons, and Wimbledon giving up the ghost and going off to play part-time in Norway. Chief beneficiaries of the change were undoubtedly Manchester United, who did lose supporters to the Irish Saints but whose new 200,000-seat stadium is now filled by all the Scottish fans who cannot bring themselves to watch Glasgow Ecumenicals. The other significant trend off the field in recent years has been in club ownership. It seems funny to think now that only a decade or so ago even the biggest clubs were run by businessmen and city types who freely confessed to knowing nothing about football. Peter Schmeichel is widely credited with having started the trend for players to take control of clubs, but he only did it in a small way for sentimental reasons. There was nothing small scale or sentimental about Sir Michael Owen cashing in his share options at all three Liverpool clubs to bring River Mersey FC into being, and at last relieve the tedium of Manchester United and Croydon taking it in turns to win the title. Croydon make the trek across London for the now traditional derby with Wembley this afternoon, with Manchester United inevitably calling in police reinforcements for the visit of White Rose. Newcastle owner Duncan Ferguson has promised to wear a kilt for the rest of the season if his side fail to win in Glasgow, while Albion Villa may part with motivation guru Stan Collymore if they fall to a fifth successive defeat at home to Irish Saints.

Wally Hammond was notoriously moody, partly because this sublime cricketer was condemned to being the second best batsman in the world for all but one year of his international career - the year before a certain Donald Bradman appeared on the scene. Denis Compton would be fine provided he turned up on time. Maybe if Botham had played in the same side as him they would have got on better. I suspect they would have shared a jar or two together to find out. Both spinners fell out with the authorities over what they had written. Jim Laker offended Surrey and the MCC, though not quite so spectacularly as Johnny Wardle. Wardle was dropped by Yorkshire and withdrawn from the party to tour Australia in 1958-9 after newspaper articles appeared under his name criticising his captain and other members of his county team. I trust he wouldn't do that in this company. Sydney Barnes was also awkward, but 189 Test wickets at an average of 16 are persuasive figures. They say he could swing, seam, cut and spin the ball at will. Not as fast as Fred, though. I sense raised eyebrows at two selections. Why David Gower rather than Peter May or Colin Cowdrey or Ted Dexter or Ken Barrington or Graham Gooch or indeed Nasser Hussain after his heroics last week? Well, I might argue that a left-hander is essential, but the real reason is that I loved watching him bat. There was a delicious uncertainty about Gower's arrival at the crease. He might enchant or waft and go very soon. And Wardle? Well, Gary Kirsten has been batting away in Durban and the pundits have been lamenting the absence of a wrist spinner to tax the brain and the technique of England's opponents - the name of Chris Schofield has been plucked out of the hat as a potential saviour just as Ian Salisbury was a few years ago. But the sad fact is that England has never produced a wrist spinner of true international class; Wardle (102 Test wickets at 20 apiece) may be the best we've had, though for much of the time he bowled orthodox left-arm finger spin. Derek Underwood or Tony Lock or Wilfred Rhodes may have been safer choices. But this trio are not so unlucky as Herbert Sutcliffe, the only Englishman to average over 60 in Test cricket. WG is no doubt fuming at his omission but he was 52 years old in 1900. He can manage the team, which means that the imposition of a curfew is unlikely...

I notice that there is only one player who performed before the Second World War. There's no Headley, Trumper or McCabe. There are no giants from the Fifties either: no three Ws, no Lindwall or Miller, no Hanif. Indeed no Pakistanis at all, which is odd. So it is a young side; it should outfield the opposition; it might outbat and outbowl them as well. It's youth may also reflect the fact cricket and cricketers outside England have improved far more rapidly over the past 30 years than those within our shores. It's taken a while for the English cricketing establishment to recognise this fact, but I think it's beginning to sink in. I have had to bat Sachin Tendulkar out of position. There were handy specialist openers available, but the prospect of contrasting and comparing the two little Indian geniuses at work was irresistible. Having seen Tendulkar play at the age of 15, Gavaskar predicted that he would break all of his records. He may still be right. Viv Richards was the greatest batsman I played with or against. Don Bradman and Gary Sobers are inked into these types of eleven without blinking wherever you live, which leaves just one batting place to be filled. In Karachi they might pick Javed Miandad; in Colombo Aravinda de Silva; in Adelaide Greg Chappell; in Sydney Allan Border or Steve Waugh; in Port of Spain Brian Lara. But it's hard to argue against Graeme Pollock (Test average of nearly 61, second only to Bradman, and a reasonably entertaining player to boot). The presence of Rodney Marsh may not be obvious, but we need an Observer man there and he has a better chance than most of keeping Dennis Lillee in order. The wicket-keeping position could have been taken up by any number of Australians and the West Indies keeper, Jeff Dujon may have been a genius standing up to the stumps.. in the Eighties we never had a chance to find out. Shane Warne is the best slow bowler I've ever seen and deserves a slot, if only because he's revolutionised the modern game. The arrival of Warne upturned the premise, sparked by the superiority of the West Indies in the Eighties, that pace and pace alone was the way to dominate world cricket. Even so, I'm happy to pick Lillee and Marshall. The manager will be Frank Worrell.

The sub-plots have been arresting. All the hype the marketing men had conjured up about the series being a confrontation between Sachin Tendulkar and Shane Warne was made meaningful by their jousts in the second Test at the MCG last week. In the previous series between India and Australia, late in the winter of 1997-98 in India, Warne found it impossible to bowl to the little Indian. So contemptuously was he treated that a man of lesser fibre would have fled to retirement. That was the time, however, when the insides of Warne's shoulder were in tatters. Although match figures of two for 140 last week did not reveal its merit, Warne's performance in Melbourne was a tribute not only to his own exceptional skill, but to the surgeon whose scalpel did the repairs. Taking the two bouts at the MCG separately, Tendulkar won the first on points with a typically masterful century. In the second, with the pitch perhaps more yielding to the blandishments of Warne's fingers, the greatest wrist spinner of all time had the upper hand. With the most subtle variations of flight and spin, he sowed seeds of doubt in the mind of his erstwhile tormentor. Once he nearly had him caught at slip, the snick falling just short of Mark Waugh, who missed nothing in this match. All right, give the benefit of doubt to Tendulkar. Maybe he played his defensive shot with extremely soft hands. But another time, on pitching in the rough, he had Tendulkar striking a most undignified posture and all but bowled him. Finally, he had him lbw for 52, shouldering arms to a ball that pitched on middle and turned towards the off stump, but so minutely that David Shepherd was in no doubt about its destination. The big bastion had fallen and Australia's march to victory experienced no further hindrances except for the new cap, left-hander Hrisikesh Kanitkar, who was amazingly calm and relaxed for a debutant. To the Australians, victory must have been all the more exhilarating because one of its main architects, with a match haul of seven wickets, was their new fast-bowling discovery, Brett Lee, a self-confident, but modest 23-year-old, whose maturity is as remarkable as his speed, which his captain, Steve Waugh, said was equal to that of Shoaib Akhtar, of Pakistan, reputed to be the world's fastest. Lee proved that this statement was no propaganda stunt on the part of the skipper. His fastest ball was 154.1kph, only 0.2 slower than Akhtar's quickest in the recent series. While Akhtar is a bit of a narcissistic showpony who, after delivering one of his thun derbolts, stands arms akimbo looking at the reading of the speedgun, Lee says that speed is not all he strives for. He says he pays greater attention to accuracy and such subtleties as change of pace, reverse swing, control of the yorker and use of the crease. He is well aware that there are pitches in other parts of the world where pace alone will not let him have his way. One suspects that his modesty and his eagerness to master the finer points come from contact from an early age with such masters of the craft as Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, who were his tutors at the Australian Cricket Academy. This copper-haired colt is the delight of the makers of helmets. When he went on a junior tour of Zimbabwe not long ago, he knocked dents into no fewer than nine specimens of the hardened headware. He has also recently put some business the way of orthopaedic surgeons. A couple of days before his selection, he broke the forearm of fellow fast bowler Jo Angel, of Western Australia, in a Shield match in Perth. A steel plate had to be inserted to mend the fracture. In the Melbourne Test, a violent lifter from just short of a length chipped a knuckle in the bottom hand of India's opener, Sadagopan Ramesh.

A rollicking start as Mike Atherton and Mark Butcher reduced the South African bowling to a disjointed shambles with a century opening stand, and a period of inactivity in the middle session as the bowling steadied and Hansie Cronje regained the control he lost, was followed by Michael Vaughan's steadfastness in a potentially profitable half-century partnership with Alec Stewart in his most garrulous batting form. It was a chance to invest in the future, as England had done on the first day in Durban. Instead, with the sun beginning to set over Table Mountain and the shadows of the floodlights lengthened across the turf, it went sufficiently wrong to send the South Africans to the dressing room with a spring in their step and England to ponder whether recklessness had not taken an undue hold over discretion after they had won the toss. England will resume this morning on 215 for five, knowing that contributions now from the rookies Vaughan, Chris Adams and Andy Flintoff are paramount if the England bowlers are going to have the luxury of a decent total at which to bowl. Vaughan, back in the side at the expense of Darren Maddy, England's only change from the last Test, already has 40 to his name and has batted for 152 minutes. Adams survived the six balls he had to face before the close when he was required to come to the crease after the downfall of Stewart and the nightwatchman Andy Caddick to Allan Donald and the second new ball, which is still only 12 overs old. As well as he played for 83 minutes, Stewart's dismissal was not a clever piece of cricket on his part. This is an adrenalin player, relying on eye and instinct and as such failures have to be accepted in order to glory in the successes. Certainly Atherton believes he has never seen Stewart bat better than in the second innings at the Wanderers and in the only innings in Durban. And yesterday he raised England's batting from a stagnant state with his habitual blend of hooks, cuts, back-foot forcing and driving. But really he should have known better than to take on Donald with the day drawing to its close, the new ball to negotiate and the morrow to play for. Perhaps he was seduced by the sounds of Jerusalem being sung with gusto from the terraces but his penultimate shot, a tennis swat over mid-on almost brought his downfall, and the next ball, with the warning unheeded, was top-edged precisely to Gary Kirsten at long leg, one of two fielders placed behind square for that purpose. The door was opened. Stewart was not the first batsman to be suckered, for Donald has taken four of the five wickets to fall, and three of them - Atherton, Butcher and Stewart - have been caught by Kirsten in the deep. Donald, in fairness, had raised his game like a true champion. At tea, while his team-mates put their feet up, the great fast bowler donned his blazer and returned to the outfield to join a select band from whom South Africa's cricketer of the century was to be named. The accolade went to Graeme Pollock but there is little doubt that Donald is their player of this century. His opening spell was wayward and lacklustre, as it frequently is while he frets about his rhythm and wrist action. But later, as Atherton and Butcher were running ahead, he returned in partnership with the wrist spinner Paul Adams and began the steadying process that saw only 26 runs from as many overs and the wickets of Atherton, hooking, for a brilliant 71, and Butcher, cutting, for 40. Nasser Hussain too, found the going tough, and was eventually out to Adams for 15, although not before he had increased his unbeaten time at the crease - taking in his centuries in Port Elizabeth and Durban - to 1,022 minutes, which is almost certainly the longest sequence without being dismissed in Test history. The opening partnership was a delight, particularly given that its highest contribution in the series so far had been seven. Atherton was the one who set the tone yesterday while Butcher was content to play second fiddle. There was a slice of good - no, incredible - fortune for Atherton when, having made 15, he drove Donald head high straight to Jonty Rhodes (he had replaced Nantie Hayward in the side), who, beginning his celebratory run from point to bowler a little prematurely, dropped the chance. Thereafter, until his dismissal in the first over of Donald's second spell - already noticeably faster and more venomous - he batted with immense skill, making the support bowling look substandard. By then his partnership with Butcher had reached 115, the third time the pair have added three figures together against South Africa, after their 179 in the first Test at Edgbaston two years ago and the 145 they added at Trent Bridge three matches later. This is the 15th match since then and until yesterday England had not again approached such lofty heights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport7", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T20:30:54Z", "webTitle": "City hand Crewe record payday", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport7", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport7", "fields": {"bodyText": "Manchester City will assure Crewe a \u00a370,000 windfall in breaking a 33-year record this afternoon.

They would have you believe they are the best team in the universe and their proud boast is that they can pick their side from a position of stellar strength - an embarrassment of riches more than enough to annihilate this long-suffering England side. OK, so they are 1-0 up in the series but reality is not quite as simple as that. The strength in depth that the home selectors keep emphasising could easily prove to be their Achilles heel before the series is out. According to one school of thought, the South Africans have left the wrong man out of their side in each of the four Tests to date. At Johannesburg on a green flying pitch they chose Paul Adams, the left-arm spinner, instead of an extra quick bowler. Adams hardly turned his arm over. At Port Elizabeth he did not play, despite a flat pitch that turned late in the game. The selectors instead chose fast and nasty Nantie Hayward, and justifiably claimed success because of his highly promising five-wicket debut. But the balance of the side was disturbed, with too many batsmen and not enough variety in the bowling, and allied to Hansie Cronje's cautious and negative captaincy it allowed England to save the game. In the run-up to Durban last week, the selectors were in even more of a quandary. They eventually decided to drop Jonty Rhodes, their No 6 batsman, supreme fielder and talisman. National outcry ensued as this time the bowling was top-heavy with Adams in. The reason given was a need to take 20 England wickets to win the match. In the end they struggled to take 10 in two days and their batting folded to rejuvenate England's hopes. Now at Cape Town the wheel has turned full circle as South Africa resorted to their Johannesburg line-up and Jonty is back. The only man who seemed surprised was Rhodes himself as he dropped Mike Atherton and misfielded in quick succession. Unheard of! The problem the South African selectors have continually and collectively failed to address is what style of play they want from their team and what combination of players can achieve it. The responsibility for the failure to press home the advantage at Port Elizabeth can be laid at the captain Hansie Cronje's door. Even without a spinner South Africa should have been more positive, and England should have been out of the series. Hitting on the right combination should not be this difficult. But first the national blinkers have to come off when the South Africans assess their bowling strength. Clearly Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock are fine bowlers, but despite his sterling work yesterday Donald is some way short of his best and Pollock is not taking wickets at the rate he would like. Lance Klusener is a bowler no longer - he has not taken a wicket in the series - and judgment of his worth is being seriously clouded by his marvellous batting record. Put simply, Klusener bowls at slow-medium and cannot get the ball off straight. He cannot be classed as an all-rounder now. Jacques Kallis is working his way back to form after injury and is far short of his incisive best. Adams is bowling well and adds a different dimension to the attack, but the one truly fast bowler who has unsettled all the England upper order, Hayward, has no place here in Cape Town. When Hayward plays it does not matter if Kallis and Klusener prove ineffective with the ball, and to have Rhodes in the side and batting at six seems to act as a collective security blanket. Most combinations have been explored, bar one. To leave out the captain. Cronje is batting poorly, averaging just 20 in the series, and should not hold his batting place. Originally chosen as captain for the first two Tests, the selectors then backtracked and made him captain for all five. As they chop and change for each Test, they may well be ruing that decision already."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport8", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T20:39:33Z", "webTitle": "Anderton returns with a warning for Sugar", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport8", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/02/newsstory.sport8", "fields": {"bodyText": "Darren Anderton hopes today to start 2000 as he means to go on, playing regularly in the Premiership. But whether he will be appearing in a Tottenham shirt for most of the year is in grave doubt. The England player is back in the Spurs squad to face Liverpool today after an absence of more than four months and yesterday toned down a fierce attack made 24 hours earlier in which he flatly rejected Tottenham's contract offer of around \u00a324,0000 a week and accused Sir Alan Sugar and his board of penny-pinching. Anderton's current deal expires this summer and his outburst, in which the midfielder claimed Tottenham lacked ambition and were not prepared to pay \"real money for top stars\", came on the day he became free to talk to foreign clubs under the Bosman ruling. The new contract, Anderton said, \"gives me only a tiny rise and I won't sign it. If they don't want me to stay, then I will go.\" The 27-year-old has been at loggerheads with the club for months over a new deal but his new-year message seemed only to isolate him further from Sugar - and from Tottenham fans who have not seen him perform since August 21, since when he has had an Achilles tendon operation. But yesterday Anderton, after coming through a practice match arranged to test his fitness, insisted he has not given up hope of signing a new contract and is due to have further talks in the next fortnight. \"I don't want to leave the club,\" he said, \"but the deal must be right for me in all aspects, and it is not just all about money. There has been speculation that I have already made up my mind to leave but that is not true.\" Today Anderton is almost certain to start on the bench against a Liverpool side who will fully examine George Graham's claim that his side's home form has been \"fantastic\". The Spurs manager envies Liverpool's strength up front - \"they've got world class forwards and I'd love a couple of them\" - and G\u00e9rard Houllier has the option of starting Robbie Fowler for the first time in three months, alongside Michael Owen, as they pursue a top-three place after taking 26 points out of the last 36. Leeds hope to exploit Manchester United's Brazilian adventure by opening a four-point gap at the top. But they may have to adapt quickly, especially in midfield, against an improving Aston Villa. Without the suspended Lee Bowyer as well as the injured David Batty, the leaders take on a team benefiting from the rehabilitation of Paul Merson - \"my talisman,\" says John Gregory - although Ian Taylor will be missing. Hillsborough is not one of Arsenal's happiest venues, but Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's team, with the old defensive guard likely to return today, should win and move to within a point of United. Sunderland, especially if the rejuvenated Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips are back in harness, should see off Egil Olsen's injury-hit Wimbledon. Four of the desperate men lock horns. Southampton, pointless over the holiday, entertain Bradford City, without a goal for 3 hours.

They are patently outgunned by their opponents, they cannot match their firepower with bat or ball, but they are clinging on defiantly in the knowledge that there's still a chance that they can sneak out of the undergrowth and grab an unlikely victory. For survival, they are dependent upon the home side squandering their resources and, in this regard, they can be encouraged since there have already been two instances of this in the series. In Port Elizabeth, the South Africans were inexplicably reluctant to drive home their advantage; in Durban, they picked the wrong side and as a result were in danger of losing until Gary Kirsten dropped anchor. The South Africans' omission of Jonty Rhodes from their team for the third Test was a fine example of the pitfalls of committee rule. Hansie Cronje apparently had no input in the decision so it would be surprising if he was not extremely miffed by the make-up of the side he was required to lead out. As ever, there was some theoretical logic to be found in the committee's decision; it would have been unfair to omit Nantie Hayward after such a promising debut in Port Elizabeth, and Rhodes is not going on South Africa's forthcoming tour to India. They just couldn't think of anyone else to leave out. But in practice it was the equivalent of sending out a football team with three centre forwards but no centre half. The balance was wrong. The South Africans, forced to follow on for the first time in 33 years, recognise that and Rhodes will return in Cape Town today probably in place of Hayward. Mike Atherton, dismissed twice by Hayward, may be relieved, but I suspect that Nasser Hussain would prefer to see a longer South African tail as he tries to chart an English victory. To achieve that he needs some significant contributions from the lesser lights. England have impressed us over the past three weeks; they have been wonderfully determined and committed but the blunt fact is that Hussain has been leading half a team. The gulf between England's stalwarts and their novices is huge. Look at the South African line-up and, now that Kirsten has scored runs, everyone has made a contribution at some point in the three Tests so far. For England, only three batsmen have hit a half-century and they are the old lags. Hussain has been magnificent, Alec Stewart has played two free innings of substance and Atherton one (in the harsh world of Test cricket he's already due again). Mark Butcher's Test career is still in limbo. We have all lauded Michael Vaughan, yet he has still to progress beyond 33. Chris Adams bristles but looks out of his depth, as does Darren Maddy. Today England will probably reinstate Vaughan. He is likely to replace Maddy rather than Adams, who will survive only because there is an onus on England to force the pace since they are 1-0 down in the series. Adams, if he ever stays in long enough, just might be able to do that. The ammunition in the bowling department is no more potent. Just three bowlers have taken four wickets in an innings in the series and one of those is Phil Tufnell, who, though bowling well, is collecting his wickets at a cost of 67 apiece. After the Durban Test, Hussain made a point of expressing his confidence in the ability of Darren Gough to have an impact on the series. Normally, the Yorkshireman is so irrepressible that such talk is unnecessary. Gough himself maybe wondering if the magic has deserted him. Expect one change to the bowling attack. Chris Silverwood, neutered by the docility of the Durban track (he'll be glad to get back to Headingley in April where the ball conveniently changes direction upon landing), is likely to be replaced by Alan Mullally. Mullally is fresh - he hasn't played for a month - but also out of practice. If he can rediscover his best, even though he has been restricted to net bowling over the past week, he is currently a more dangerous bowler than Silverwood. Indeed it was mildly alarming in the last Test that Hussain came to consider Andrew Flintoff a more dangerous bowler than Silverwood. So it's tough to predict an English victory as they embark on their first Test of the millennium. However, it is possible, on the evidence of the last three Tests, to predict with some confidence that England, despite being sapped by three long days in the field in Durban, will scrap like fury to stay in the series in Cape Town.

Even before he took seven for 46 in the first innings of the Durban Test, Andrew Caddick had established himself as an integral part of this England side. Pecking orders are not to be encouraged in pursuit of team unity, but the simple fact is that Caddick has superseded Darren Gough and all the others. He is now recognised as England's most reliable bowler, the cornerstone of the attack. In the first two Tests in South Africa, he had taken only four wickets, yet still not even the doubters were complaining. He had bowled OK - with plenty of spirit and perseverance and not much luck. He was patently 100 per cent committed. The signs were obvious even when he wasn't bowling. There was that stunning catch to dismiss Jacques Kallis at Port Elizabeth as he forced his giraffe-like frame to hurl itself to the ground so that he could emerge triumphant with the ball in his right hand; there were a couple of doughty knocks with the bat when he stood up to Allan Donald and Shaun Pollock. Of course I've always maintained that he has been 100 per cent committed, but I've usually found myself in the minority. At Somerset there has been constant bafflement over the past few years that the England hierarchy should have questioned his attitude. To take 350 first-class wickets in the past four English seasons requires heart as well as talent. If confirmation were required you only had to be at Taunton last September at the end of a long, long season for Caddick. Against Lancashire he bowled 35 overs in the day, taking eight for 113. He would not have bothered if we believed some of the criticisms levelled against him over the years. His tour place was already secured; his reputation restored, yet it was impossible for the captain, Jamie Cox, to wrench the ball out of his hand - not that he wanted to. Wicketkeeper Rob Turner said he was bowling faster at 5pm than at 11am. The rhythm was with him so he just wanted to keep going. Caddick prefers bowling to fielding. Successive Somerset captains have treasured him; not all have liked him greatly, but they recognised that he was their match-winner.Yet throughout most of his England career he has been treated with suspicion in the press box and the dressing room. Until the elevation of Nasser Hussain, all his England captains have had reservations. Graham Gooch was probably wary of his birthplace - Christchurch, New Zealand. Gooch misguidedly set so much store by anthem and flag. He struggled to accept anyone born outside the country playing for England and queried their commitment - although this did not deter him from popping off to South Africa in the early Eighties. Mike Atherton, at least, picked him more often than not, although by his own admission he often struggled to get through to him. Atherton was always incapable of hiding any doubts he felt about players in his side and he clearly had a few about Caddick. Alec Stewart did not pick him at all when he was captain. Indeed, Caddick's omission from the tour party to Australia last winter, after he had taken 105 first-class wickets for Somerset in 1998, was one of the most scandalous non-selections of the decade. Stewart - despite the fact that he embraces him oh so warmly when Caddick conjures an outside edge into the wicketkeeper's gloves - has to bear responsibility for this (he also declined ever to pick Phil Tufnell, who at least had some form as a troublemaker, unlike Caddick). But the other selectors were culpable as well. One of their duties is to quietly point out when their captain is adopting the most blinkered and self-destructive of policies. Steve Waugh, dismissed five times by Caddick in his Test career, could not believe his luck. Hussain is brighter and immediately brought Caddick back last summer for the series against New Zealand. I suspect that he could identify with Caddick's predicament easily. Like Caddick, Hussain has never been regarded as clubbable. He too had spent a long time exiled from the England team because he didn't quite fit in; too self-obsessed, not an obvious team man. It is alarming how easily judgments can be swayed by personality rather than ability. I remember joining the tour to Zimbabwe and New Zealand in 1996-97 and being stunned to hear that sages from Ian Botham downwards regarded Chris Silverwood to be a better prospect than Caddick. Silverwood was patently whole-hearted, a superb trier, an eager listener (he still is); Caddick was distant, seemingly aloof, reluctant to take advice... but obviously the better bowler. If Silverwood had not been injured before the penultimate Test of that tour, Caddick might not have played at all during that winter. It is also true that Caddick has not always helped himself. On his first overseas trip to the Caribbean, he managed to disenchant a chunk of the press corps by his aloofness (he scarcely knew any of them) and by the fact that he kept wandering into the press box to use their phones. He can be gauche, and has the capacity to put his foot in his mouth. On a subsequent tour to the West Indies, he naively asserted that he knew how to get Lara out. His comments rebounded on him when he failed to take a wicket in the ensuing Trinidad Test on a seamer's paradise. He has sometimes frozen out in the middle when assaulted by the likes of Lara, which was the case in Port of Spain. Afterwards he was reluctant to concede that he had bowled poorly. This was interpreted as arrogance; those closer to him argued that he did not have the self-confidence to admit to his frailties. Peter Anderson, the chief executive at Somerset, knows him better than most. He has employed him for over a decade as a pace bowler and in the early days as a Mr Fixit in the maintenance department during the winter months. He says: 'Andrew is not a natural social mixer with people he doesn't really know. He can appear to be abrupt and abrasive, but that is purely a natural reaction born out of inherent shyness. There is not an evil intent in his body.' Moreover, he has matured since those early days. He accepted his omission during the Stewart regime with remarkable phlegm. He tinkered with his bowling; there was a technical adjustment to be made as he entered his delivery stride and he refined his strategy. He placed more emphasis on accuracy and patience. Now confident that the wickets would eventually come, he stopped straining for those unplayable deliveries. He didn't worry too much about the pundits yearning for him to bowl two feet fuller in length. Most importantly, he discovered an England captain, who has absolute confidence in him. Both these 31-year-olds are determined to make up for lost time. Hussain now has 2,918 Test runs; he should have 4,000. Caddick has 106 Test wickets; he should have 150. In the past their talents have been wasted. Now, at least, they are universally appreciated.

I was emphatically wrong on two issues; the introduction of women to the MCC and - maybe more importantly - the return of South Africa to the cricketing fold. I assumed that neither would take place until beyond 2000. The international cricketing community will continue to expand. In the nineties back came South Africa and Zimbabwe were introduced; in this decade expect Bangladesh to secure full Test status; maybe Kenya will follow. England have always been wary of widening the base of international cricket as their attitude to the latest arrivals, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, betrays, but they can hardly object now. Recently the England team have been unable to beat either of these sides. They could do with some opponents that are obviously inferior especially since New Zealand no longer come into this category. With more teams the international schedule will have to be rationalised. As the globe shrinks tours will become shorter; the Ashes series will last in its present format longer than most but my guess is that by 2010 it will no longer be played over five Tests. Some form of league table for Test cricket will be adopted with the top two sides playing a final every one or two years. However it is international one day cricket that needs urgent attention. Countless, haphazard fixtures take place each year from Sharjah to Toronto. Except when the matches are part of a World Cup no one cares a jot who wins them, which leaves the way open to all sorts of skulduggery. A competitive structure for one day cricket needs to be established, also incorporating league tables, to augment the World Cup. The marriage between TV and cricket will continue to be prickly but essential for the survival of the game. The players may crave privacy on the field and in the dressing room; the directors will want to stick microphones and cameras in every possible cranny. Modern technology will enlarge the role of the third umpire. The two umpires out in the middle will phone their friend ever more frequently, checking whether the ball pitched outside the line of leg stump or whether an edge is discernible. But they not the third umpire should be the final arbiter. Mistakes will be reduced but there will be no shortage of controversy. At home the cynics will have it that 18 teams will still be battling away in the equivalent of the Benson and Hedges Cup in April 2010, so intransigent are the counties. Those in the shires argue that they have actually compromised significantly in the last decade: they have accepted four day cricket and two divisional cricket as well as pouring money into their academies as encouraged by the ECB. Will there still be 18 counties? It's odd. Just about everyone agrees that there are too many sides yet in 2000 there is one more first-class outfit than in 1990 with Durham's elevation in 1992. The counties are hardly likely to vote for their own abolition, but drip by drip a genuine two tier system will probably emerge. Currently there is the safeguard of three up, three down in the two divisional system that has been introduced for both Championship and one day cricket. Soon that may become two up, two down, then maybe one up, one down in an attempt to create a genuine premier division, where all the best players reside and where, theoretically, the standard is closer to Test cricket than it is now. This is England's major headache. The gulf between first class cricket and Test cricket is too great. The consequences of this are that our new international players have to try to learn their trade in their first few Tests. The ostracism of overseas players, a suggestion, which to my amazement, is still advanced, would only make that gulf wider. On a more cheerful note someone - perhaps even the ECB if they can find some money - will surely have the enterprise to construct a stadium with a roof and lights that is dedicated to cricket. If ever there's a climate that cries out for such a facility, it is ours. And this would offer scope for a winter county league to keep our pros honest and in employment. Now the easy bit: by January 2010 Sachin Tendulkar will have overtaken Allan Border's aggregate of Test runs, Mark Nicholas will have finished his stint as Chairman of Selectors, Michael Vaughan will have retired as England captain and the pundits will be pining for the golden era of the nineties."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "sport/2000/jan/02/cricket8", "type": "article", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-02T20:59:59Z", "webTitle": "I'm no chucker says Shoaib", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2000/jan/02/cricket8", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2000/jan/02/cricket8", "fields": {"bodyText": "Banned Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has declared himself the best bowler in the world - and claimed that if he is a 'chucker' so is every second bowler in international cricket.

The ruling bars him from the lucrative triangular one-day series against Australia and India, starting next Sunday. It also raises doubts about his forthcoming contract with Nottinghamshire. 'I'm simply the best and better than the rest,' Shoaib said. He added that the ICC had told him his short-pitched deliveries caused concern, but he was mystified about why he had been singled out. 'I'm still confident there is nothing wrong with my action - it is totally fluent,' he said. 'It doesn't stop anywhere - if I stopped and then I pitched the ball, that is wrong, that is throwing. I don't stop my arm anywhere. 'They say I bend my arm a little bit. If I do, every second bowler does all around the world. I can mention four or five names that have been playing Test cricket for ages.' He said he had accepted the ICC decision and vowed to clear his name in time for next month's three-Test home series against Sri Lanka. When he arrives home, he will work with the former West Indies fast bowler Michael Holding, a member of the ICC panel who banned him, in an effort to eliminate any doubts about the legitimacy of his action. 'I'm a little disappointed, but it's OK. We are part of the system and with a brave heart I accept this,' he said. In Sydney, Australian captain Steve Waugh said that he was saddened by the ICC's decision to ban Shoaib. 'I must admit I was a bit shocked,' he said. 'It's disappointing for the player and probably a little bit disappointing for the game because he's such an exciting bowler.

In 1958 Hanif Mohammad occupied the crease for 970 minutes before being dismissed. If Nasser Hussain, after his efforts in Port Elizabeth and Durban, can bat for a mere 33 minutes this morning he will assume the mantle of Most Dogged Test Batsman Ever. For a horribly long time on Thursday, it looked as if a slopie* (a man who has a misshapen forehead after banging it against a brick wall once too often) might also be in contention as Gary Kirsten remained unbeaten for 879 minutes. Then Mark Butcher, with the last ball of the Test, bowled him round his legs and the rope* (implying he is thick, coarse, hairy and twisted) was undone. It was a glorious moment which quite outshone the fact that England drew the Test. Thanks to Butcher, Hussain stands alone on the threshold of the record that the dull hairybacks* (self-explanatory) would most like to hold. There were those swift to chide Nasser for his magnificent performance on Boxing Day (51 not out from 218 balls in 285 minutes). Some even booed him. Morons. This series has everything to do with taking on the rock spiders* at their national sport: Grinding out a result. The English are out to prove not that they are better cricketers but that they are grittier. To this end, Hussain should contrive, by any means, to win the toss, and elect to bat. Atherton and Butcher should then block for as long as it takes for Hansie Cronje to start setting defensive fields. Usually a little over twenty minutes. It is at this moment that the game will become a true Test of grit with Cronje offering singles and Atherton refusing to take them. Given luck, the scoreboard might remain static for an entire session. Nought for nought at lunch could, with application, stay that way by tea. Shortly thereafter, Butcher would feign injury and retire hurt to allow Hussain the time in which to break the record. Cue massive celebration. By day two the jaapis*, completely out-gritted, would collapse and then, and only then, the English could go on the attack. By mid-afternoon on day four they might even think about a declaration. In classic Cronje-style they would, of course, decide to bat on. The game, in all probability, would be drawn but immense psychological damage would be inflicted on the slopies. There is a precedent. In 1989 Eddie Charlton travelled to the Crucible and ground out an excruciating 10-9 first round victory over Cliff Thorburn. The next year the extremely dour Canadian slipped out of the World's top 16, never to return.

He registered his fourth consecutive golden duck as India collapsed before the pace of Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath. Agarkar had been dismissed first ball in each of his three previous innings on the tour and Lee sent him packing with an outswinging yorker that he edged straight to Mark Waugh at second slip. \"I couldn't really get the smile off my face. I was quite happy about it,\" said Lee, whose brother Shane picked up four wickets for the Australia A team in their win over Pakistan yesterday in Perth, prompting speculation of another sibling partnership in the Test side to add to the Waughs. Brett Lee took three wickets in eight balls to finish the opening day with four for 25, coming within a ball of a hat-trick for the second time in his first two Tests. Not to be outdone, McGrath collected three for 34, claiming the scalp of the captain Sachin Tendulkar. Tendulkar, his side already 2-0 down in the series, was again left to carry India's hopes after the top order collapsed to 69 for four by tea. He responded with a typically gallant display, belting eight boundaries to reach 45 at almost a run a ball. He smashed three of those in one over from McGrath before the Australian fast bowler broke through with a ball that cut back and struck him on the pads. McGrath was later warned by the umpires for his explosive reaction to the dismissal, after he ran down the pitch and eyeballed Tendulkar. Lee, who had match figures of seven for 78 in his Test debut in Melbourne a week ago, tore through the Indian middle order with his intimidating speed. Hrishikesh Kanitkar (10) and Vijay Bharadwaj (six) were both caught by the wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist before Agarkar edged to Mark Waugh. Mark Waugh, who received a standing ovation on his home ground as only the fourth Australian to play 100 Tests, also took a sharp chance to dismiss the opener Mannava Prasad. oA defiant century from Azhar Mahmood was the only batting bright spot for Pakistan who, preparing for the limited-overs triangular series with India and Australia, lost by 52 runs yesterday to Australia A in a day-night match at the WACA.

And I always say, when something is right, God makes you know.' A stone's throw from the noise and bustle of London's Marble Arch, 40-year-old Mother Aelred, Adorer of the Sacred Heart, is contemplating the idea of 'becoming' a nun. 'People have these ideas of what a nun is like, and one of the reasons my friends were so shocked at what I was doing was that I didn't seem like their idea of a nun. Some people think a nun is someone who can't cope with life; others that you've been hurt in love or had some terrible trauma. I know some of my friends thought something must have been going on in my life that they didn't know about.' Her home, Tyburn Convent, stands near the site where the Catholic martyrs of the Reformation died on the gallows. But Mother Aelred, then Christine Norden, had never heard of Tyburn when, 12 years ago, she went to visit the London convent's sister house on the outskirts of Sydney in her native Australia. Originally Anglican, at 22 she had converted to Catholicism, scandalising her parents. Now she was about to scandalise them further, by entering a silent and enclosed order of Benedictine nuns. 'It didn't seem right for me at all - I love talking, and I really enjoyed the outdoor life,' she says. 'I'd been to university and done a degree, I'd worked as a personnel officer and I could have carved out a good career for myself. But there was something missing.' Mother Aelred says that as she grew older she realised that, whatever she did with her life, it would have to be done wholeheartedly: 'I knew I'd want to give myself totally to it. And I couldn't find a man, or a career, or anything else that I felt was enough to give myself to totally. Until the convent, and that fateful day. 'The only way I could do anything totally was to do it for God. For a while, I thought I'd probably become a missionary or join an active religious order. But then a friend wrote and asked me if I'd considered joining this convent in Sydney which had some connection to a convent in London. And while I was thinking about it, by chance, I read an article in a magazine about the Adorers of the Sacred Heart - it was very strange!' The moment she set foot in the chapel of the Sydney convent, Mother Aelred knew it was right for her. 'I could see the sisters across the chapel praying, and I knew this was the life I yearned for, what God was calling me to do,' she says. 'I went to see the prioress and said that if I'd had no commitments I'd join them. And she said, do you mean that? Because if you want to, you can. 'I couldn't believe it could be so simple - that I really could take this step. But knowing it could happen didn't deter me at all - I wasn't scared; I was absolutely certain this was the right thing.' Despite the protestations of her family and friends she decided against sitting the final exams in the nursing course she had been taking. 'They thought that if the convent didn't work out, I'd at least have finished the course - but I didn't need that kind of insurance policy, I knew it would work out,' she says. Four weeks after her first visit, having sold her car and given all her possessions away to friends, Christine was back on the convent doorstep. She left behind a deeply hurt mother and an angry father, but she has since been reconciled with her parents. And her friends were just incredulous. 'The reaction of the friends I told was interesting: they basically divided into two camps. The first were so amazed they never mentioned it again, and the other group were fascinated and they just asked me questions all the time. But most of them thought, give her a fortnight - she'll be back.' Despite being on the other side of the world from many of her friends, Mother Aelred still corresponds with some of them. 'A lot of people I've known keep in touch - and they're not all churchgoers. I hear from people who have no belief, and often they ask me what I think of something or what I'd do if I were them.' The life Christine embraced is, by any standards, an austere one - and radically different from her previous existence. 'When I first entered the order I wore ordinary clothes, but eight months on I was clothed in my habit. Instead of the jeans and shorts I'd always worn, I was in this thick, long habit and veil,' she says. There was no television to watch, no lie-ins to relish - the nuns rise at 5am - and the independent life she had led before was exchanged for the strict rules of a religious order. The level of obedience expected from the nuns is so great that seven years ago, Mother Aelred was summoned to be told she was being transferred from Sydney to her order's mother house at Marble Arch, where she remains today. Has she, for even a moment, regretted her decision? She is laughing before the question is out: she cannot contemplate regret in the context of this decision. 'I'm not saying it's always easy, living here with 18 other women and my family on the other side of the world, but what we are doing here is giving witness to the Gospel values. We are a little oasis of prayer in the midst of a big city, and we mean a lot to a lot of people.' Downshift From restaurant chef to environmental activist All her life, Joyce Hambling has loved food. Wooed by its luscious variety of textures, flavours and colours, she chose a career in restaurants, first as a waitress and later as a chef. Jobs in high-profile establishments such as London's L'Escargot nurtured this love, and five years ago she decided to become a self- employed caterer. Prestigious contracts to provide food for events such as London Fashion Week followed. Then Greenpeace asked her to cook for them. 'I can only describe what happened as a road-to-Damascus conversion. My first thought when I got the Greenpeace contract was that they would look good on my client list. I had always thought of food in terms of its gorgeousness - how much olive oil you could throw at a dish, that sort of thing.' Towards the end of 1996, Greenpeace environmental campaigners were involved in blockading the port of Liverpool to prevent the first genetically modified crops coming into the UK. 'I decided to find out a bit more about why they were doing this, and read an article in Guardian Weekend about the possibilities of growing oranges in Scotland and mange tout in Manchester if these foods were genetically modified to flourish in an alien climate. At first, having been brought up in an age of scientific discoveries, I thought wow, but by the end of the article I was saying, 'Oh, my God, what would that mean for countries in east Africa who have moved away from what they used to grow traditionally so they could have an export crop?' 'It suddenly occurred to me that I couldn't let these Greenpeace campaigners blockade while I just cooked their lunch. I felt that if I didn't make a stand too there would be nothing left to cook with.' What she describes as 'a steep learning curve' followed. She became involved in the Genetic Engineering Network, a loose coalition of people and groups sharing information about genetic engineering. She has abandoned her catering business to work for them full time, collating news and email lists. The job has not been funded, so at the moment she has no salary. 'I've lost all my muscle tone because I no longer rush around carrying huge sacks of potatoes - instead I'm sitting at a desk reading through all this material. I read much more than I used to and always want to know the other side of the story.' Aside from her passionate commitment to the campaign, Hambling, 35, believes the new way of working has liberated her. 'I'm free of all that 'I've worked an extra 15 minutes so that's an extra \u00a33.20' stuff.' Even the luxuries she used to enjoy, such as grabbing a taxi, taking a friend out to dinner or buying a new pair of shoes, she has happily forgone. 'My change in direction has made all sorts of differences. I used to be the sort of person who would wear matching lipstick and nail varnish, but now I don't even know where my last dried-out mascara is. Some people think I've taken on sainthood and others think I've joined the ALF. 'The only trouble is that I'm in danger of becoming a bit boring because I love what I do so much and think about it all the time. Let's face it, there aren't many people who want to talk about intellectual property rights when they go to a party. Upshift Sara Denver, nurse turned solicitor At the age of 18, Sara Denver set her heart on becoming a nurse and embarked on almost four years of training - first a degree, then a course to specialise in cardiothoracic intensive care. 'I loved my job, I was doing something practical and I enjoyed working with people.' After spending such a long time training, it never occurred to her that she would want to change, particularly to a career which would involve an even longer period of study. But a chance conversation with a disaffected doctor who had decided to jettison medicine in favour of law had a profound effect on her. She began to find out as much as she could about training and what a job as a solicitor would entail. 'I wanted to find out as much as I could, as once you've left a career it's quite hard to go back to it.' Research completed, she decided that law would suit her perfectly. And she hoped that when she qualified she would be able to use some of her skills gained in the NHS to specialise in medical negligence cases. Another protracted training stint followed - this time for five years - with a one-year law conversion course then two years of legal practice and finally a two-year training contract with a firm of solicitors. 'I qualified in September and it feels great. I loved the challenge of studying for something new; law was something I really wanted to do for myself but at the same time I think I've chosen something useful.' While she doesn't know of many lawyers who have changed career direction, Denver, 32, can think of many colleagues from medicine who are now doing different jobs. She says an increasing number of medical negligence cases are being taken out, which means an abundant supply of work is likely. 'I don't know whether the incidences of negligence are increasing or whether people are becoming more aware of legal action as an option.' She is certain there won't be any more lightning career changes. 'This is it now. I'm so much happier in this career; I feel I can really make a difference to people. I would recommend changing direction to anyone. Explore the options thoroughly, but don't be afraid of change.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "money/2000/jan/03/personalfinancenews.business", "type": "article", "sectionId": "business", "sectionName": "Business", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T00:00:00Z", "webTitle": "Lloyd's site falls victim to hacker", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/jan/03/personalfinancenews.business", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2000/jan/03/personalfinancenews.business", "fields": {"bodyText": "Lloyd's of London, the world-leading insurance market, was yesterday forced to close down access to its website - not because it had fallen victim to the millennium computer bug - but because an old-style computer hacker managed to break into the system.

That should benefit the euro, the single currency which made its debut on the foreign exchanges a year ago and has since lost about 13% of its value against the US dollar. \"We expect during the course of this year the euro will go in the opposite direction... The euro has strong upward potential,\" the ECB president said in an interview on Dutch television last night. Looking ahead to economic prospects for Euroland in 2000, Mr Duisenberg said: \"We now expect growth in Europe during the course of this year to be faster than growth in America and that will remain in 2001. \"That is the basic background why we say the euro now has upward potential.\" The fall in the euro from its launch rate of around $1.17 to near parity has proved a mixed blessing for the euro zone. So far the region has been able to enjoy the benefits of a competitive exchange rate without inflation taking off but the decline in the euro's international value has done nothing to enhance its prestige as a reserve currency. Part of the reason for the decline has been the relatively sluggish performance of leading Euroland economies compared to the US but the currency has also been bedevilled by rows between the Frankfurt-based ECB and the German government over the need for Europe's biggest economy to restructure. Such openly conflicting views, coupled with the ECB's studied avoidance of intervention in the foreign exchanges, helped maintain the downward pressure on the fledgling currency. Although Mr Duisenberg and his colleagues are keen to see the euro recover at least some of the ground lost over the past year, the ECB president sought to play down the importance that tended to be attached to the exchange rate. \"Europe needs to learn a little bit, I think, that the effect of a change in the level of the currency on the national economy... is much less for the whole single Europe than it was earlier on an individual member state.\" During the interview Mr Duisenberg risked reopening the controversy over how long he will stay at the helm of the ECB. The former Dutch central bank governor was appointed to the ECB for an eight-year term but a behind-the-scenes row was settled by an informal agreement that Mr Duisenberg would serve only part of his term before handing over to the governor of the Bank of France, Jean-Claude Trichet. The squabble caused con cern in the financial markets where there was concern that the compromise over the presidency could be a sign that the ECB would not be as independent of political interference as had been expected. In last night's interview Mr Duisenberg refused to be drawn on when he would quit but appeared to insist that he would be the one to determine when he would stand down. \"I'll be 65 this year. Certainly I'll still do a number of years, but whether I'll stay the full eight years, I haven't taken that decision yet.

As president of Nacods (the national association of colliery overmen, deputies and shotfirers) from 1980 until his retirement in late 1985, Sampey was involved in virtually every step of the year-long miners' dispute, from its beginning with the closure of the Cortonwood pit in 1984. Along with the general secretary of Nacods, Peter McNestry, he led a key section of the mining industry, albeit with a mere 16,000 members at the time; the role of Nacods as 'pit foremen' was crucial to the conduct of that bitter, desperate and historic dispute. It was Sampey who initiated a compromise that might have settled the strike halfway through and, with hindsight, might perhaps have rescued some rump of an industry that had once been the basis of Britain's vast industrial power. Nacods did not join the national union of mineworkers' strike at the outset, though Sampey felt strong sympathy with the NUM protest and was fiercely critical of the way Sir Ian MacGregor ran the coal board. Many Nacods men refused to cross NUM picket lines; even in the Notts coalfield, where the NUM breakaway refused to strike, Nacods members were uneasy. So Sampey put forward his compromise to Sir Pat Lowry, then chairman of Acas. Its main feature was a new and final stage in the review procedure for all pit closures, including those already listed by the coal board. The new independent review body would take evidence from everyone, including local communities. It was an enterprising initiative and came close to succeeding. Sampey and McNestry felt that the chance of peace lay in their hands and, to force the issue, Nacods leaders decided to join the NUM strike from October 25 1984. They were convinced that neither Mrs Thatcher's government nor MacGregor actually wanted a compromise deal, but were concerned mainly to crush the NUM. The Nacods decision rocked the Conservative cabinet. This was the moment when a compromise deal could have been made. The TUC leaders thought so. So did Acas. Mrs Thatcher's cabinet was split and Sir Ian MacGregor was fearful. But Arthur Scargill and the NUM turned away from Sampey's peace plan, and Nacods leaders then decided to settle separately and call off their strike threat, much to the anguish of the TUC and the Labour Party leader, Neil Kinnock, who believed a compromise deal was within reach. Even then Sampey personally tried to persuade MacGregor to meet Scargill in one more 'final' bid to salvage something. But it came to nothing. Sampey came from a long line of miners, and was born in the old mining village of Edlington, which was the home of the now defunct Yorkshire main colliery on the outskirts of Doncaster. He worked in the pit, at the coal face, as had his father before him. For although he was educated at Maltby Grammar School, his family couldn't afford to support him in further education, so he went down the pit at 16. When the second world war broke out, he volunteered for the RAF and became a navigator with coastal and bomber command. After the war, he trained as a pit deputy, returned to Yorkshire main colliery and became deeply involved in trade union and local politics. He was soon a member of the Nacods Yorkshire area executive and, shortly afterwards, of the union's national executive. In the early 50s Sampey was elected to Doncaster town council, before being elected to the newly formed South Yorkshire county council in 1974. He later became deputy leader of the county council, during the period when Sir Ron Ironmonger led it. One of Sampey's proudest claims was that his local government work enabled him to help a young blind boy from Sheffield, who was interested in local politics. With Sampey's help, the youngster climbed the local educational ladder and went on to some remarkable achievements. The boy's name? David Blunkett. Sampey was awarded the BEM in 1976. He is survived by his wife Joan, two daughters and three sons.

Advisers to the company have applied to the German takeover commission for an extension to this Friday's deadline because of the bid falling over the holiday season. The clock was set ticking after Vodafone launched its \u00a385bn offer document on Christmas Eve. Vodafone has cut short the usual 60 days for shareholders to declare their hand to 46 days from publication of the offer document, making the cut-off point February 7. Mannesmann still hopes to publish its defence in the first half of January. Despite attempts by Vodafone's chief executive, Chris Gent, to play down the hostile nature of the largest bid in corporate history, the battle is becoming increasingly acrimonious. Mannesmann yesterday took full-page advertisements in the British national press which suggested acquisition would have a \"profoundly negative\" effect on the German company. The defence document is expected to focus on Mannesmann's growth prospects as an independent company. Mannesmann chief executive Klauss Esser argues that earnings will increase by 50% next year. Last week, Mr Esser wrote an open letter to shareholders which was published in German newspapers. He accused Vodafone of withholding information related to the risks associated with the bid. Vodafone has published its offer document in English and German but the 440-page listing prospectus for new shares, which includes a five page section on potential risk, is not yet available in German. Possible problems highlighted include the adverse effect of minority shareholders in Mannesmann if its bid succeeds. Debt would be \"substantially\" increased, which might harm its credit rating, while earnings per share would suffer \"substantial dilution\". In the letter Mr Esser said: \"Vodafone's offer involves a number of significant risks for any Mannesmann shareholder who accepts it. Do not be misled. In the English-language prospectus for its new shares Vodafone admits there are grave risks involved. Remarkably, Vodafone has not published a German version of this very important document. Form your own opinion as to why Vodafone is withholding the presentation of these risks from you.\" Vodafone said it was \"totally wrong\" to suggest it was withholding information. A spokesman said the warnings were simply standard information and the German version would soon be available. Vodafone approached Mannesmann to cement their relationship through an asset swap in April but went on the offensive after Mannesmann launched a bid for the British firm's domestic rival Orange. If the Vodafone bid is successful it intends to relist Orange on the stock market. The bid could drag on until the middle of 2000 because German law states that no single shareholder can vote more than 5%. Vodafone might not be able to remove Mannesmann management until the law is rescinded in June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "business/2000/jan/03/3", "type": "article", "sectionId": "business", "sectionName": "Business", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:45Z", "webTitle": "Union seeks Kitemark for partnerships", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/03/3", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jan/03/3", "fields": {"bodyText": "Sir Ken Jackson, leader of the Amalgamated Electrical and Engineering Union, is urging the government to adopt an independent Kitemark of approval for partnership agreements between companies and unions.

A key ministry of defence committee was due to make a recommendation to the cabinet on the choice of missile for Britain's 232 Eurofighters shortly before Christmas. But, in evidence of the far reaching import of the decision, it deferred its choice until February 21. Alan Garwood, deputy chief executive of Matra Bae Dynamics, the Franco-British missile-maker, said the Russians were in talks with the Chinese to develop a Ramjet version of the AA-12 Adder missile built by Vympel. He warned that the Russian missile, due to enter service in 2005, would be more deadly than anything available to European and US armed forces and could end up in the arsenal of countries such as Iraq and Pakistan.

Then, there he is, in a sharp navy suit and shiny lavender tie. He is instantly recognisable except for one detail: it's as if someone has ironed his face. Ever since the mid-70s, when John Hurt emerged from the classical theatre into the cathode glare of television, his parchment features have seemed to hold all of life's disappointments, all its bad mornings-after-worse-nights-before, in its creases and folds. Reviews of Krapp's Last Tape, the Samuel Beckett monodrama which brings him back to London this month, give no reason to expect any different. 'What makes Hurt a natural for this role,' wrote one critic, 'is that he possesses a face full of wrecked Rembrandtesque fascination, suggesting acres of pained and mysterious hinterland, and a voice that has an extraordinarily kippered lived-in intimacy.' Another critic suggested that, with his seamed, pouchy features and shock of close-cut, iron-grey hair, he bore a striking resemblance to Samuel Beckett himself. Hurt himself has said that 'what I am now, the man, the actor, is a blend of all that has happened'. Yet today his face looks ironed smooth of past troubles, and there are three possible explanations. One is that he is happy, and his new-found domestic stability - in Ireland, with a woman 20 years his junior - has combined with a new-found sobriety to smooth his features. Another possibility is that he is thriving on being back at centre-stage again. 'When you've been away from an audience as long as I have - and it's four years since I was last on stage, in A Month in the Country - you do begin to miss an audience.' A third possibility, offered by Hurt, is that he doesn't buy the view of Beckett as an old miserabilist. And since part of being an actor is selling what you're doing, John Hurt is selling good humour. 'He had to put up with so many misperceptions, poor old Sam. He's got this reputation for being gloomy but he's actually not at all,' he says. When pressed, he concedes that Krapp is a moving play - 'not just touching but seriously moving; it's a whole life; it's everything. The point about Beckett is that his writing is so good that there is only one way to do it. He seems to distil it and distil it until he's got only the finest alcohol left.' In what depths of his own experience does Hurt find a performance that has been described as invaded by pain? 'Heaven knows where it comes from. It wouldn't have occurred to me that I could do it, but then I don't think actors are very good at choosing their own parts,' he says. I had expected him to be tetchy about personal questions but he only looks awkward when he is asked about acting. 'I dread these questions. You see, you can't talk about it. It's an imaginative leap in the end, not an intellectual leap.' Twenty years ago, when he'd just appeared in Alien, in which his stomach had ripped open to produce a monster, an American reporter asked if he was a method actor. Hurt tore open his shirt to reveal an appendicitis scar, and snarled: 'Listen, if Robert De Niro can put on a few pounds...' Actually, he says, 'Though I've been quoted as saying I don't like method acting, what I don't like is when acting becomes therapy. I find that troublesome.' As he says it, he gives a glimpse of the quiet fretfulness that infused his portrayal of the lonely writer Giles De'Ath in his recent film, Love and Death on Long Island. Besotted with a Hollywood teen idol, and besieged by technology, his features seemed to play obsession like a piano: now tragic, now absurd, now magnificently selfish. He can pack a whole emotional universe into the twitch of an eyebrow, a sardonic slackening of the mouth. It is a performance so compelling, so 'real' that I find myself wondering whether Hurt is obsessive; whether, unlike De'Ath, he can handle a video or a fax machine. This is the irony that has dogged Hurt's career: he is not the sort of heroic actor who annexes roles to his own overwhelming personality. Rather, he is a character actor - 'not,' he says, 'in the American sense of someone who is always the same, but in the English sense of someone who plays characters.' Yet there has been a common thread through three decades of work and 90-odd films - a sense of melancholy, of waste, of self-loathing. It's there in Stephen Ward, the Profumo fall guy of Scandal; it was there in the junkie convict of Midnight Express, in the effete Caligula of I, Claudius and - perhaps most memorably - in The Naked Civil Servant, his TV film based on the autobiography of Quentin Crisp. However accomplished, however technically composed these performances have been, people have always looked for clues to them in his life. He finds this irritating .('I've had people say they had me in mind when they wrote something, and I've always said, 'Which bit of me?''). Yet he has displayed a clumsy genius for allowing his life to hold a mirror up to his art. He has admitted that, while shooting Midnight Express (1978), he got through up to seven bottles of wine a day. After White Mischief (1987), a film about dissolute Kenyan settlers, he and his second wife, Donna, built themselves a mansion in the Kenyan hills and had public spats about his drinking. More troublingly, in the run-up to Champions (1983) - a biopic about the jockey Bob Champion - his long-term partner Marie-Lise was killed in a riding accident. In talking openly and honestly about her death, he allowed it to become a film-marketing dream. Wisely, perhaps, his two young children from his third marriage, which broke down in the mid-90s, have been declared a no-talk zone. He is clearly terrified of endangering his relationship with them. Hurt is as candid as ever about himself, though: 'I suppose I had a reputation as a hellraiser,' he says, 'but it's very odd because I never really was. It's just that I lived very publicly and never pretended to be private. I've always lived in the streets. I still walk everywhere and, of course, I've been drunk like most people have, but I just got unlucky, like I did at school. If ever I did anything wrong, I always got caught.' The trouble began at a prep school in Kent, where Hurt - son of a strict Anglican vicar - was regularly beaten. It followed him into his 20s, when he found himself trapped in a shotgun marriage to an actress who said she was pregnant. The baby didn't materialise and the marriage didn't last. 'Sometimes,' he says, 'life is very difficult to take undiluted.' Then he grins at the Beckettian seriousness of the statement, and becomes gleeful in his reminiscences. 'Oh I've been set up many times - like that famous punch-up after the Bafta ceremony. Really it was a non-incident. I was in the back of the hotel talking with some friends and the photographers wouldn't go away. One of them was being particularly cheeky and I said, 'Enough is enough,' took a swing at him and missed. The next day there it was across the world: 'Bafta Biffa'. Well, quite honestly, I don't give a toss what people think in that sense.' His refusal to play safe has had its benefits - not least the role he regards as one of his most extraordinary: The Naked Civil Servant. He was given dire warnings by his professional minders. 'They essentially said if you play an effeminate exhibitionist homosexual, you'll never work again... But I didn't have any qualms because I didn't think that was what it was about.' The most backhanded tribute came from Quentin Crisp, with whom Hurt remained friends until his death last year. 'I told Mr Hurt it was difficult for actors to play victims, but he has specialised in victims,' wrote Crisp. 'When he stopped playing me, he played Caligula, which was only me in a sheet. Then he played The Elephant Man, which was only me with a paper bag over my head.' Although The Naked Civil Servant is now regarded as a classic, at the time it was greeted with some ambivalence - as was The Elephant Man, in which, entombed in a mask made of 27 moving parts, he laid bare the torment of the horribly disfigured John Merrick. It's a source of some resentment for him that Love and Death on Long Island did not garner the honours of those earlier films. 'I'm not bitter about it but I just don't understand it. It got the most incredible reviews of any film I've ever made. If a film had had that reaction 15 years ago, everything would have been very different. It does make one wonder where we are when, because of the film distribution system, because of who's in control, because we're dictated to by market research, we can't educate our own country in its own culture.' If that makes Hurt sound like outdated Giles De'Ath, he rattles happily around the countryside, near Dublin, with 'the girlfriend' - music PR Sara Owens - and a cosmopolitan gang of modern singers, chefs and pop managers. And he hopes to mark his 60th birthday this month by making his film directing debut. 'I've resisted, but friends seem to feel very strongly that I should.' You can see why he would make a good director. He is happier talking angles and takes than the more abstract ideas of an actor's vision, and he can be gloriously rude about directors he has worked with. One reason why he loves Beckett, he says, is because the writing is so precise that there really is only one way to do it. 'That, you see, isn't a restriction, it is freedom.' The photographer arrives and he produces a broad, smooth smile for the camera. Then a doubt puckers his face: 'How's the neck? Like a turtle, I expect,' he deadpans. It's a perfect moment - Quentin Crisp scripted by Samuel Beckett. Those old friends, the creases, are back.

The Sharpeville Six were sentenced to hang in 1984 for murdering a town councillor, stoned to death during a township demonstration. There was no evidence that Mr Khumalo or his co-accused participated in the killing, but they were convicted according to a now disgraced law, which held that anyone joining a protest was responsible for the actions of the others in the crowd. The six were released in 1991 after the then president, F W de Klerk, began dismantling apartheid. But Mr Khumalo and his fellow prisoners have not been able to find regular work, and they remain stigmatised by their time in jail. In 1998, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission recommended that 22,000 people receive compensation of up to \u00a315,000 each to help them buy homes, to educate their children and to pay for medical care. But the government has decided that the victims will receive a few hundred pounds. So far, 8,000 people have received `interim' payments of 2,000 rand (\u00a3200). `Two thousand rand won't do anything,' said Mr Khumalo. `There are children who lost parents and that won't get them an education. There are people in wheelchairs - 2,000 rand won't pay their medical bills. `If the aim of the present government is to restore dignity for an injustice done to us, they ought to discuss this with us - not dictate terms like imposing the 2,000 rand.' Just two years ago, the ruling African National Congress (ANC) argued that substantial compensation was crucial. `Unless there are meaningful reparations, the process of ensuring justice and reconciliation will be flawed,' it said in a submission to the truth commission. Last year, however, senior officials and ministers began backing away from this position. There is considerable bitterness among the victims about the amnesty that was granted to many of apartheid's human rights abusers: Not only are the abusers now immune from criminal prosecution, they also cannot be sued for civil damages. Last month, the former apartheid law and order minister, Adriaan Vlok, who oversaw a police force that murdered and tortured with virtual impunity, was granted amnesty for his part in the bombing of the offices of South Africa's trade union confederation. `We have been betrayed,' Mr Khumalo said. `The previous government gave Vlok and the killers golden handshakes and the present government gave them amnesty. [But] the victims have been left empty handed.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/03/suzannegoldenberg", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:49Z", "webTitle": "Hijackers' vanishing act stokes Indian suspicions", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/03/suzannegoldenberg", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/03/suzannegoldenberg", "fields": {"bodyText": "Two days after they waved goodbye to their terrified captives aboard a hijacked airliner and drove off into an Afghan sunset, there was no trace yesterday of the five Islamist gunmen who for a week held more than 155 people - and the government of India - to ransom. The authorities in both Afghanistan and Pakistan say they have no knowledge of the whereabouts of the hijackers, who owe their allegiance to the Harkat-ul-Mojahedin, an Islamist organisation fighting New Delhi's rule over Kashmir. However, the Indian foreign minister, Jaswant Singh, told reporters on Saturday that the five masked men - whom he did not identify, although he said they were Pakistanis - had left the southern Afghan city of Kandahar together with the three men whose release they won from Indian jails. Mr Singh was quoting the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan, who brokered the deal that ended the hijacking drama on their soil. On Friday, the Taliban gave the hijackers 10 hours to leave the country. A few hours later, the Taliban announced that the men had disappeared, and that the Afghan hostage who was guiding them to the border had returned to Kandahar. With the Pakistani border city of Chaman just a three-hour drive from Kandahar, the obvious conclusion is that the gunmen drove straight to the frontier. However, there was no way of knowing whether the five were travelling with the men whose release they engineered: a Pakistani-born preacher; a Briton, jailed in India for the 1994 kidnapping of western tourists; and a militant leader from the Indian-held part of Kashmir. Despite all spending several years in Indian jails, none of the three has been convicted of a crime. If the hijackers eventually turn up in Pakistan, it may prove uncomfortable for Islamabad, which has claimed on several occasions that India was unfairly seeking to implicate its intelligence agencies in the crisis. It would also be a propaganda coup for India, which has made the war on global terrorism a tenet of its foreign policy in recent months. But Islamabad is determined that this will not happen. Within hours of Mr Singh's statement that the hijackers were Pakistani, Islamabad retaliated with a denial: 'Levelling of baseless and false accusations against Pakistan is part ... of Indian tactics,' a foreign ministry spokesman said. Pakistani authorities insist that the hijackers will find no refuge there. 'Under no circumstances will these persons be allowed to enter Pakistan,' Moinudeen Haider, the interior minister, told the official Associated Press of Pakistan. 'Pakistan is on high alert. In case they enter Pakistan territory they will be apprehended and tried as per established international rules and conventions to which Pakistan is signatory.' However, that is almost impossible to guarantee. The borderlands between Pakistan and Afghanistan are mainly untamed mountain and desert, and much of the terrain is in federally administered tribal areas, where Pakistan's legal writ does not run. Afghans and Pakistanis do not need passports or visas to cross the border, and with border posts often left unmanned, it is often possible for even western travellers to slip across unnoticed. The hijackers have a crucial advantage: they kept their balaclavas on throughout the eight-day ordeal, and the Indian authorities have yet to identify them. As for their three guests, Pakistan would presumably have no objections to their presence on its soil, and they would probably receive a heroes' welcome in Pakistani Kashmir."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/03/richardnortontaylor.johngittings", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:50Z", "webTitle": "Utopia or dystopia?

Then we were encouraged to look forward to a new international age, free from superpower strife, when efforts would be focused on real problems: poverty, ill-health, injustice and the environment. The UN-led war against Saddam Hussein encouraged optimism: the international body, no longer paralysed by the veto, was able to act against aggression. The US and Russia began to roll back their arsenals and the fear of global obliteration receded. Those forecasts now seem hopelessly utopian. New conflicts have broken out in areas we were hardly aware of; world poverty continues to rise. There are two new nuclear powers. The UN's reputation has been deeply dented by its inadequate response to a string of humanitarian crises. The mood is shifting from utopia to dystopia. What sort of world are we living in where the perspective can change so fast? Predictions remain difficult but four areas will vitally affect our global future - the prospects for China, Africa, the UN and disarmament. China China enters the new millennium as a giant with shaky foundations. Assessments of its prospects from outside continue to be wildly inconsistent. Will it become the world's second economic power within 20 years or be brought down by massive political and social contradictions? Is a strong China good for Asia or a potential threat? Everyone agrees on one thing: stability in China is crucial for the region and the world - note the huge sigh of relief in 1997-98 when Beijing refrained from devaluing its renminbi currency, and thus saved the Asian economic crisis from becoming a global disaster. The greatest risk now faced by China, many believe, is that the communist regime will fail to adapt and will meet the same fate as that of the Soviet Union, plunging the country into chaos and risking disintegration. Certainly the current leadership of Jiang Zemin has disappointed by maintaining the brake on political reform. Somehow the momentum checked by the 1989 Beijing massacre has to resume. Yet the comparison with the Soviet Union is inexact. China's version of perestroika, unlike that of Mikhail Gorbachev, will continue to deliver enough goods to enough people to buy acquiescence. The politically alienated of 1989 are already returning to make money. More will come back when Beijing joins the World Trade Organisation. Patriotism is not a discredited concept, and a sense of common identity - far stronger than the artificial Soviet version - will endure, reinforced by the overseas Chinese community. The party is not loved, but neither is it hated; instead it is seen as an apparatus of government which in one form or another China needs. Popular protest at corruption and privilege focuses on specific complaints, without demanding the party's overthrow. But China will pay an increasingly high environmental price for the policy of maximising the growth which buys it stability. In the long run, pouring concrete over fertile land is a recipe for disaster. Mounting floods and diminishing naturalresources will hit particularly hard those in poor areas who have already missed out on the economic boom. By the year 2050, a population well above 1.5bn people will face severe water and land shortages, heightened by a growing concentration in urban areas near the coast. Pollution could rise by 600%, with hidden costs to health and productivity. Cities will fail to provide adequate services for the rural migrants on whom they depend, and whose numbers should reach 220m within 10 years. The police and security forces will be strengthened to deal with rising crime. As in Indonesia, an underclass of the under-employed will provide a reservoir of social unrest. China's complete entry into the world market will remove the last barriers which have cushioned its economy: the renminbi will fluctuate and export industries will become increasingly vulnerable to competition from other developing labour forces. Beijing's nightmare scenario - a surge of domestic unrest coinciding with a western economic slump - will one day become reality. China will pour resources into defence and prestige projects to achieve the aim of becoming `the giant of Asia'' by the year 2050, leading to recurrent tensions with Japan and an unstable Russia. The love-hate relationship with the US will be tested to destruction over Taiwan: sooner or later (probably sooner) Beijing will be tempted, or obliged for internal political reasons, to make a challenge across the strait. Repression of alleged `splittism'' in the non-Han Chinese western regions will provoke what it seeks to prevent: the challenge will come first from Muslim militants in Xinjiang, then from Tibetan activists after the death of the Dalai Lama. Slowly new generations will realise that the only solution to these problems is to reject the concepts of centralised rule based on the Chinese empire. Africa Will Africa be the forgotten orphan of the 21st century? It limped out of the 20th with little more prestige or autonomy than it had at the beginning of it, when most of its states were ruled by European colonialism. It will not be in a position to reverse this powerlessness alone, and it will be in the rest of the world's urgent self-interest to offer massive financial and technical aid. This will be the only way to stem Africa's contribution to the growing problems of global warming, the spread of the Aids pandemic and unrest in Europe as the angry poor outnumber the rich with the influx of men fleeing economic and political insecurity in Africa. The speed of technological change in the 21st century, and the world's domination by a knowledge-based economy will be a threat, rather than an opportunity, for the continent. Inevitably this trend will further marginalise Africa. On present trends, in 15 years three-quarters of all the world's school-age children who are not able to go to school will live in Africa. The yawning education gap will prevent the continent moving towards more democratic and accountable government. Instead it will still be prone to see its people swept easily into the primitive fascist movements which have managed in the late 20th century to destroy country after country in west and central Africa in civil wars. These wars for resources, easily fired by ethnicity, by extensive drug abuse and by the use of impressionable children as cannon fodder could simply spiral on from one generation to another with no political force capable of redrawing the map of these countries' alternative possibilities. One new force of the century will be the increasingly powerful non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The erosion of national sovereignty in the face of the western human rights lobbies was one of the more remarkable phenomena of the last two decades of the 20th century. In the 21st it will be not only the confident and ambitious NGOs which dictate policies to African governments, but the multinationals who will be obliged by their shareholders to answer publicly for every policy or financial transaction in the countries where they operate. United Nations An effective UN will be crucial for the 21st century, as nation states show no signs of being able to regulate disputes peacefully and ethnic conflict is on the increase. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, has been publicly criticised in an independent report for his role in the UN's failure to prevent genocide in Rwanda in 1994. This report came hard on the heels of Nato taking the lead in the Kosovo war; on the long stalemate on Iraq which reduced its people to abject poverty; and on the failure of UN-supervised elections and years of fruitless negotiations in Angola. Meanwhile the US continues to hobble the organisation by failing to pay its dues in full while demanding the right to approve all significant UN initiatives. Yet expectations of the UN are higher than ever, while international law is changing to give it a wider mandate. As environmental and man-made catastrophes multiply, UN agencies will be asked to perform miracles to bring food and medicine to millions of victims. The UN's future will depend on how soon these new pressures lead to structural change. These must include the long postponed enlargement of the security council, more democratic decision-making, more secure funding for specialised agencies and the formation of permanent peacekeeping forces. The prospect of any of this happening may seem unlikely now. But international disaster in the 21st century will concentrate minds and promote a new demand for international solutions. Disarmament The world will face new types of conflict which national governments and even established groupings like the EU are still not prepared for, despite their rhetoric. The threat of further proliferation will put the prospects for nuclear peace throughout this century to a severe test. A new arms race will also start if the Nato allies fail to dissuade the US from plans for a national anti-ballistic missile shield. President Bill Clinton is expected to give the go-ahead to this expensive `Son of Star Wars', which is enthusiastically backed by the Republican candidate George Bush. The Democratic front-runner, Al Gore. may have to support it reluctantly. The strong security element in the Russian leadership - enhanced by the rise of Vladimir Putin - increases the danger of conflict between a revanchist Moscow and the US, with a side-current of discord between the Nato powers over how far Russia has legitimate security concerns. The Europeans believe that the US wants a series of `regional anti-missile shields'', one to protect Israel, another for Taiwan and Japan. The plan is also directed at China, provoking Beijing's military to a new arms race. Moscow has also reacted angrily to US proposals to amend the 1972 anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty and is deploying more advanced missiles. European concerns are deepened by the US senate's refusal last year to ratify the comprehensive test ban treaty. Prospects for the non-proliferation treaty review conference, to be held in New York in April, do not look good. The five official nuclear weapons states are not giving a lead. Indeed, the US is developing new warheads for its Trident system, on which Britain relies. Instead of constructing nuclear shields, western strategy will have to find new ways of bringing `pariah states'' into the international community. As the environment deteriorates, new sources of conflict will also emerge over scarce resources such as water. The next one or two decades will be make or break time for the choice. We can either continue down the road of nuclear proliferation, with ever smaller weapons, plus chemical and biological weapons, which can also be used by terrorists. Or the nuclear five must take a new road to convince the world that they are serious about disarmament."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "news/2000/jan/03/guardianobituaries.simonbeavis", "type": "article", "sectionId": "news", "sectionName": "News", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:52Z", "webTitle": "Sir Christopher Harding", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jan/03/guardianobituaries.simonbeavis", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/news/2000/jan/03/guardianobituaries.simonbeavis", "fields": {"bodyText": "Christopher Harding, who has died aged 60, made a quiet but profound impression on that bleak territory occupied by the nuclear power industry. Charming and diplomatic, he was the first atomic power industrialist to appreciate fully that public acceptance of this controversial industry had to be won. He spent much of his business life with ICI, the Hanson Group, and latterly with United Utilities and Legal &amp; General. But it is for his time, 1984-1992, at British Nuclear Fuels, the state-owned nuclear reprocessing giant, that he will be remembered. Without those years, it is inconceivable that BNFL should stumble towards privatisation, under a Labour administration. A bank manager's son, he was educated at Merchant Taylor's School and read modern history at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He joined ICI in 1961 and spent eight years as a personnel officer before being headhunted by Lord Hanson to work for and ultimately run the Hanson transport group. He remained a non-executive director of Hanson Trust until 1997. He joined BNFL as a director in 1984 and became its part-time chairman on April 1 1986, working with Neville Chamberlain, a BNFL veteran, as chief executive. The two replaced Con Allday, who had combined both roles. BNFL had a reputation for poor safety and obsessive secrecy. Crass manoeuvres, like substituting the name Sellafield for Windscale, and numerous safety scares incompetently hidden from the public, had left an indelible impression. When he and his chief executive took up their posts, a wry commentator pointed out it was symptomatic of the company's PR problems that only BNFL could choose April Fool's day to announce that Neville Chamberlain was replacing a man called Con Allday. Harding immediately invited Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth to talks about the company's operations. Making the nuclear case was considerably more difficult thereafter, especially after the Chernobyl disaster, which struck weeks into his BNFL tenure. At Sellafield and other sites, he strove to represent the workforce, while preaching the simple doctrine that a successful nuclear company was a safe one. It was his idea to open the popular Sellafield visitors' centre, lending Britain's most eerie industrial site the feeling of a science theme park. In the London HQ, he talked to endless detractors and doubters, making the case for nuclear power with a disarming earnestness. Meetings were often followed by hand written letters of thanks. But glasnost opened the door to another set of problems. Openness about safety issues made it inevitable that more detailed answers would be demanded about BNFL's extraordinary finances, dominated by multi-billion pound liabilities for the clean-up of nuclear installations and huge investment in new installations like the Thorp reprocessing plant and, now, the mixed oxide fuel plant. BNFL found it as hard to make the financial case as it had been to make the safety case. Its reputation for trying to blind its critics with science was replaced with a reputation for blinding them with economics. This was not helped by British nuclear companies portraying BNFL as an unhealthy monopoly. The first accounts produced after Harding's retirement from BNFL were held up for many months: when finally published, they were stamped with a rare warning from the company's auditors that they could be rendered invalid because the Tory government had removed a pledge to underwrite \u00a317 bn worth of reprocessing contracts. BNFL, like its nuclear cousins, continues to struggle to answer the economic and safety cases, but it does so from a position unrecognisable 10 years ago. After BNFL, Harding continued to make the case for nuclear power through the pressure group, Supporters Of Nuclear Energy. He chaired the industrial services group BET, but failed to protect it from takeover by Rentokil in 1996. He faced criticism for his characteristic loyalty to the incumbent, but underperforming, management team. In 1997, he was offered the chair of United Utilities, replacing Sir Desmond Pitcher, who lost two chief executives in quick succession and a great deal of investor confidence. Harding brought in a new chief executive and put the business back on an even keel. From 1994, he was also the chairman of the life insurance company Legal &amp; General, which he helped steer towards a merger with the NatWest, only to be thwarted by a counterbid for NatWest by the Bank of Scotland. Other chairmanships included the Newharthill Group, the private holding company of the construction group, Sir Robert MacAlpine, from 1993, and the GEC remunerations committee. His public work notably included the Prince's Youth Business Trust, where he chaired the advisory board. He was knighted in 1991. He had a collection of well over 1,000 egg cups, which moved wherever he worked. He was married first to Susan Berry, with whom he had a son and a daughter, and then to Franc\u00e7oise de Laperri\u00e8re. He found happiness with his third wife, Anne Skelley, whom he married in 1994. They had a daughter.

Ambitious and intelligent, this is period drama that never gets hidebound by the distracting eye-candy of costumes and settings.

Whereas the woman who did open the door was invariably Ena Sharples. Raquel (Sarah Lancashire) of the Rovers Return was the barmaid every man dreamed would serve him, leaning like the blessed damozel from the gold bar of heaven, backed by shining spirits in bottles. A barmaid in excelsis. Beautiful as a daffodil though not as bright. A fine comic creation but entirely without a sense of humour. Three years ago she left Curly, her husband, and Coronation Street (ITV) and went to Kuala Lumpur, the sort of place scriptwriters send you if they are secretly in love with you. Otherwise you go to Lowestoft. On New Year's Day Curly answered the door and it was Raquel. Then again, it wasn't. Offered a glass of good wine by Curly (who had been keeping it for a special occasion that never occurred) she said 'Oooh! Syrah and Grenache!' And seeing his stunned look, added 'The grapes it's made from. I'm getting leathery undertones.' 'If you don't like it...' began Curly helplessly. Raquel was now living in a French chateau, 'It's not an enormous chateau. It's not huge. It is a proper chateau though. It's detached and everything.' The skin between her eyebrows puckered with unaccustomed thought. 'What's so funny? It is detached and everything.' She wanted a divorce to marry Armand, a wine-grower, being, as she mentioned in passing, preganant. 'Only just, mind you.' Dawn was breaking - you wondered if this was a dream - and she was anxious to get back to Curly's daughter, Alice, and Armand's daughters, Madeleine and Elene. 'That's like what we call Helen except they don't sound the aitches in France.' 'No,' said Curly soberly, 'we don't in Weatherfield. We're very French in that respect.' Raquel is luminous but not bright. Curly once named a star after her, and she vanished with the first light as stars do. This was, unusually for Coronation Street, a duet and profoundly melancholic. There was a natural magnificence about Michael Gambon's performance as John Harrison in Longitude (Channel 4) Rawboned, provincial and powerful, he invented the first accurate nautical clock. Not unlike Dr Johnson, who, about the same time, was compiling the first dictionary with the same heroic labour (and sharing Harrison's poor opinion of the sea). In 1714 parliament offered \u00a320,000 for the first practicable solution to finding longitude at sea. A fortune for the time, but only \u00a310 for every sailor drowned when Sir Cloudesley Shovell wrecked his fleet on the Scillies, believing he was off Brittany. With latitude as his belt and longitude as his braces, a man could face the unknown unafraid and, indeed, unexposed. The proposed solutions were Swiftian. Wounding dogs, on the theory that they would howl at noon. Mooring a chain of 600 barges across the Atlantic. Harrison was a carpenter, a rude mechanical, and his solution was mechanical. A clock which kept GMT reliably at sea. If you knew Greenwich time you could calculate, from the sun, how many degrees east or west you were. Sailing home with his first sea-going clock, Gambon stood foursquare on the deck and shouted that they were heading for the rocks. 'According to my calculations, that is the Lizard Rock. I am not mistaken. I'd set my life on it. You are 60 miles west.' This is a flag-planting declaration of faith like Galileo's 'But it does move' or Martin Luther's 'Here I stand.' It was the Lizard. Your skin prickled. The story swung invigoratingly between horology and Hornblower. It also tick-tocked between Harrison and Rupert Gould (Jeremy Irons) who, two hundred years later, restored the neglected masterpieces. Written and directed by Charles Sturridge, it was a magnificent leap of faith (and a safe landing) for Channel 4. You were always comfortingly conscious of rock solid performances, ballasting the film. Apart from the big wigs, I was unusually aware that somebody made the model ships, that somebody rebuilt Harrison's exquisite clock for the film.

He is RL Stine, a 53-year-old New Yorker who outdid JK Rowling and Roald Dahl yesterday by emerging as the author whose books are borrowed most from secondary school libraries in Britain. His hallmark is buckets of gore, jokily poured into books written almost as fast as those by Blyton, which featured the placid Noddy and Big Ears and the Famous Five children, and which ruled the children's book market for much of the last century. Stine began taking his brother to horror films at the age of nine. His motto is: 'It's fun to scare people - and it's fun to find out a new way to scare them every time.' Best known for the Goosebumps series, he writes with a skeleton and a tribal mask by his side. He sells 1.75m copies a month and works on two titles at once. In the survey, he beats his only two conceivable rivals into second and third place - Terry Deary, who writes the irreverent Horrible Histories series, and Dahl. Terry Pratchett comes fifth, while the author of the Asterix comics is 23rd and Sue Townsend 28th - all above Rowling's 43rd, with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as her most popular title. The hobbit man, JR Tolkien, is 42nd, Shakespeare is 50th, Blyton 59th, and CS Lewis of Narnia fame 66th. Charles Dickens is 104th.

The scheme, to be announced this week by David Blunkett, the education and employment secretary, is designed to provide an exciting and enriching experience for all young people at the end of their years of compulsory education. Camps running between June and September will offer outdoor trips including climbing, orienteering and survival skills, some of which may take place abroad. Other options will include extended work experience and voluntary jobs in the local community. Mr Blunkett is particularly anxious to target the thousands of young people who leave school at 16 without qualifications and have no plans for further education, training or work. He fears that many will become permanent dropouts unless something is done to awaken an interest in continuing education. But the government thinks places at the camps should be offered to all 16-year-olds, regardless of academic attainment or family income. Ministers do not want the courses to be seen as a reward for underperformance. A department of education spokeswoman said: \"We want to give teenagers real-life experience which will help them to grow up more quickly. At the moment, some adolescents find it difficult to make the transition between school and adult life. These courses will make them ready for the adult world much sooner.\" Mr Blunkett is expected to explain how the scheme will work in an address to the north of England education conference in Wigan on Thursday. It will be a joint initiative with Chris Smith, the culture secretary, and is likely to be funded by lottery money. Discussions are planned with local authority leaders and others who might be able to organise camps. Details, including the level of funding, and whether participants might contribute themselves to the cost, remain to be determined. Ministers hope the first might begin this year. Attendance would be voluntary. \"This is not some new kind of national service,\" the spokeswoman said. \"The aim would be to make these camps sufficiently attractive that youngsters would want to come on them.\" Courses are likely to vary but ministers envisage that travel and outdoor experience will form an important ingredient. Possibilities could include mountaineering in Wales, building a well in Africa or camping on Dartmoor. Mr Blunkett is aware that many young people already gain similar experiences from the Duke of Edinburgh awards or organisations such as Camp America. However, these teen-agers tend to be from middle class families only. \"This would not simply be an experience for the few, but an opportunity to contribute to the community, to focus on volunteering and active citizenship and perhaps offer extended opportunities for experience in the world of work,\" the spokeswoman added. Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, yesterday welcomed the proposal. \"I would send some of the kids away for more than six weeks,\" he said. \"Some could do with several years. But the summer camps would do no harm and they could do a lot of good, particularly for children who feel school has no relevance to them.\" David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, dismissed the suggestion that young people should pay to attend the camps, adding: \"They will stand or fall on their ability to attract students with what they can offer. I'm sure the schools will offer encouragement and work with parents to ensure they do attend.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "technology/2000/jan/03/lifeonlineaguidetotheinternet.education", "type": "article", "sectionId": "technology", "sectionName": "Technology", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:57Z", "webTitle": "Ex-pupils offer internet revision tips for GCSE success", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jan/03/lifeonlineaguidetotheinternet.education", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/jan/03/lifeonlineaguidetotheinternet.education", "fields": {"bodyText": "A company founded by two schoolboy entrepreneurs to publish GCSE study guides is preparing to launch a free internet revision service with notes provided by some of Britain's finest teachers. The company's bosses, now first-year students at Oxford, claim the site will revolutionise learning and take the slog out of exam preparation. 'We are doing what the government is failing to do - providing the best education for everyone,' said Nick Rose, 19, who, with his partner Jordan Mayo, 18, left Manchester grammar school last year. Mr Rose, from Sale, Greater Manchester, is studying politics, philosophy and economics at Lady Margaret Hall when not using his hands-free phone in a penthouse office near the Bank of England in London to raise a six-figure start-up capital fund. 'We've been told we need to go in first and flashy to capture the market,' he said. The company's website has been registered in Italy so that it can be called Revise.it. 'I thought that was kind of funky,' said Mr Rose. 'I never did like all that dot.com stuff.' Despite their being rude about the government's education policies, Mr Rose and Mr Mayo have already received a letter of support from that well-know technophobe Tony Blair. 'At the back of our minds, both when we were at school and now, is the idea of sharing our education and passing on the massive benefits we have had,' said Mr Rose. 'We have not yet met one person who does not think this is a fantastic idea. The best thing about it is that if you wake up in a panic at 4am on the morning of your maths exam, you can do some instant revision. The information is instantly available and it's free.' Most mainstream GCSE subjects will be covered when the service goes live in March and A-level guides will be introduced later in the year. Staff at Manchester grammar, including three who are shareholders in the company, have so far been commissioned to produce revision notes. 'It's quite ironic having to chase teachers up and trying to keep them to deadlines,' said Mr Rose. 'We want the best teachers we can find and we don't care about their background or what kind of school they come from.' About a third of Britain's school students have access to the internet at home and another third have access at school. 'We hope that once schools see the service online they will realise it is a resource they cannot do without.' Mr Rose and Mr Mayo admit that they are also in business for the money and the buzz. 'We tried writing a maths GCSE guide together but a teacher told us it was rubbish,' said Mr Rose. 'So now I stick to the business side.' 'I love meeting consultants, bankers, solicitors and venture capitalists.' For reasons of commercial secrecy, he said, he was unable to reveal how he and Mr Mayo would make the profits from their revision service. 'We have various clever ideas that our web people have come up with and we're also using tools that can only be provided by the internet.' Revise.it Ltd has been launched with the help of profits generated by the modest success of the original book-form revision guides. 'I phoned every Dillon's and Waterstone's in the country to persuade shops to take them,' said Mr Rose. 'My greatest success was when Waterstone's in Preston took 20.' The young entrepreneurs eventually sold out to Oxford University Press, which is about to bring out the chemistry and biology guides. The advance has been shared between the authors and the royalties will go to Manchester Grammar's bursary fund to provide school places for boys whose parents cannot afford its fees."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "politics/2000/jan/03/labour.labour1997to99", "type": "article", "sectionId": "politics", "sectionName": "Politics", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:57Z", "webTitle": "Build loyalty or face revolt, Callaghan warns Blair", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/jan/03/labour.labour1997to99", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2000/jan/03/labour.labour1997to99", "fields": {"bodyText": "Tony Blair was warned by James Callaghan yesterday that he would face a cabinet revolt unless he governed in a more collegiate way. In a mild rebuke, the former Labour prime minister called on Mr Blair to open up cabinet discussions to ensure loyalty and understanding from senior ministers when the going got tough. 'When times become more difficult \u0085 then of course you need all your colleagues to be associated with the problems that you're facing,' Lord Callaghan told BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour. `You must be able to command not only their loyalty but also their understanding. The best way to do that is to have full discussions of whatever problems you have.' Lord Callaghan, who has been generally supportive of Mr Blair, stressed that he was not criticising the prime minister who 'had done extremely well'. But the ticking-off from Britain's last Labour prime minister will fuel criticism of the presidential style of government which has led one Downing Street insider to compare Mr Blair to Napoleon Bonaparte. Mr Blair, who, from being elected Labour leader, made no secret that he intended to 'govern from the centre', holds short cabinet meetings lasting about 45 minutes. All the government's big decisions are made in cabinet sub-committees or in discussions with ministers. But Downing Street is un likely to heed Lord Callaghan's warning because Mr Blair is determined to avoid cabinet splits like those that occurred in the Callaghan and Wilson years. Lord Callaghan held long cabinet discussions as he tried to win consensus among colleagues, ranging from Tony Benn on the left to Denis Healey on the right. In the interview, he also warned New Labour supporters not to sever the party's relationship with the trade unions. 'Anybody who suggests that [the relationship] should be discontinued would, I think, be wrong,' he said. But Lord Callaghan, who was beaten by Margaret Thatcher in 1979 because of his failure to tame the trade unions, admitted that he had allowed the union barons too much power. 'In the late 70s and in the 80s in particular the unions became overweaningly powerful and they intervened too much on issues that were purely political. We encouraged them to do so, so of course we're responsible for that.' He added that the right balance had now been struck with the unions, and praised Mr Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, for rescuing the Labour party from its 'unsatisfactory' state in the 1980s. Lord Callaghan, who calls himself Original Labour rather than New Labour, sympathised with Mr Blair's habit of consulting Baroness Thatcher more often than himself. But this did not say anything about New Labour's policies, he said. 'I think all it says is that he turns to somebody who won four [sic] elections instead of somebody who didn't win any.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/03/northernireland.johnmullin", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:57Z", "webTitle": "Machete attack kills Antrim unionist on estate in grip of drug dealers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/03/northernireland.johnmullin", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/03/northernireland.johnmullin", "fields": {"bodyText": "Police in Northern Ireland were last night questioning several people over the murder of a father of three children, less than five hours into the new year. They said that they were unable to rule out a sectarian motive. Denver Smith, 32, a Protestant from Antrim, whose three daughters are aged between seven and 11, was married to a Catholic, Bridget. He was killed in a machete attack in the town's mixed Stiles housing estate, which, increasingly, is in the grip of drug dealers. Republicans helped stamp out a mushrooming drugs trade in the nearby Rathenraw estate, but suppliers have switched to the Stiles area. One local politician described parts of the estate as being a 'little Beirut', with houses and garages burnt out where the drug dealers operate. Friends said Smith, a campaign worker for the Progressive Unionist party, linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, had been attacked as he made his way to a house party. A minibus had dropped him off along with several other men after the group had seen in the new year at the local football side's social club. Smith, described as probably weighing more than 20 stone (127kg), had been unable to run when a gang of six men set on the group. He was hit on the head a dozen times with a machete, and stabbed several times with a large pike. The attackers screamed at locals as they went to his aid. One witness said one shouted: 'Let the bastard die.' As police swooped, suspects were seen jumping through windows. It is thought officers seized clothing that was being rapidly washed, but also took away some blood-soaked items. Smith was taken to Antrim area hospital just after 4.30am on Saturday. He was pronounced dead three minutes after he arrived. The attack came about two hours after another incident involving a gang that attacked a house in the area. There is speculation that the UVF was behind that, either in a row over protection money or in a campaign against dealers. But Smith's friends hotly denied that he was either involved in drug dealing or in the UVF attack on the house. He is believed to have had no criminal record. Ken Wilkinson, a spokesman for the PUP in south Antrim, said Smith had been a close friend who had driven a vehicle for him during council election campaigns. They had been at the social club function together He said Smith's widow and daughters were in shock. The funeral is expected to take place on Wednesday. 'I am convinced that there was nothing sectarian about the attack,' said Mr Wilkinson. 'It was, instead, the work of criminal elements. There is no doubt about that. He was set upon by a group with hatchets, machetes and crossbows. There was no escape for him. 'Most of the Stiles estate is decent, except for a small corner around where he was hacked to death. The drug dealers openly sell everything you could imagine while standing around oil drums with fires blazing in them. 'Antrim is gaining a terrible reputation, one of the worst. It is becoming the drugs supply capital of Northern Ireland.' Residents in the area heckled Paddy Marks, the Ulster Unionist mayor of Antrim, as he arrived at the murder scene. He said he had hoped the authorities were winning the war against drugs, and promised to step up efforts to stamp out the burgeoning problem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/03/johnezard", "type": "article", "sectionId": "artanddesign", "sectionName": "Art and design", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:58Z", "webTitle": "Smoke bomb masks burglar's theft of \u00a33m Cezanne", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/03/johnezard", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/03/johnezard", "fields": {"bodyText": "The theft of a \u00a33m painting by Paul C\u00e9zanne in Oxford on millennium night was carried out by a professional burglar who created a smokescreen to foil security cameras, it was disclosed yesterday. With the noise of his break-in masked by celebratory fireworks, the burglar cut a hole in the roof of the Ashmolean museum and descended to its art gallery by rope ladder. He had a holdall containing a scalpel, tape, gloves, a smoke canister and a small fan. He set off the canister, and used the fan to spread the smoke and obscure the view of the gallery's closed circuit cameras. In less than 10 minutes, he had seized the painting, View of Auvers-sur-Oise, climbed up the ladder, and gone. Behind him he left the holdall, gloves, scalpel and tape. Yesterday a Thames Valley police spokesman refused to discuss the method behind the biggest of a series of recent thefts and attempted thefts from the 317-year-old Ashmolean. But a police source said: `It was a very clever ploy, a very professional theft. The burglar only entered the room where the C\u00e9zanne was hanging, and that appeared to be his only target. `He obviously knew exactly what he was doing. He used the smoke device to prevent any security cameras or patrolling guards from seeing his face.' The smoke caused a university porter to call the fire brigade. When the firefighters arrived and realised there was no blaze, they found the remains of the smoke canister. It was only then that the police realised there had been a break-in and that an alarm was flashing near where the painting should have been. Specialists in art theft had been called in by Thames Valley police, a spokesman said. `This is not a crime which is going to be solved overnight. We are more used to run-of-the-mill crimes. We need expertise.' Customs and immigration staff at sea and air ports have been warned in case an attempt is made to smuggle the C\u00e9zanne abroad. Superintendent John Carr of Oxford police, who heads the investigation, said: 'Whoever has taken this painting has given some thought to how to steal it. The person has some reason for it, and some outlet for it. One possibility is it has been stolen to order.' The Ashmolean's director, Christopher Brown, said security at the museum had been the same on Friday as on any night of the year. Dr Brown described the painting as an important early transitional picture from the very early work to the mature C\u00e9zanne, showing a small town near Versailles in which the artist lived for a short time. 'It is the only C\u00e9zanne we have in the Ashmolean, and it is very important as an example of late 19th-century painting. This is not just a criminal act but a very selfish act. 'The pattern in previous similar thefts is that pictures have been retrieved.' In 1997 three men tried to steal a 1,100-year-old jewel made for Alfred the Great from the Ashmolean, but in attempting to smash a display case they set off alarms. In 1996 two 17th-century French bottles were stolen. Earlier in the decade there was a spate of thefts from the museum and from Oxford colleges. View of Auvers-sur-Oise was painted between 1879 and 1882 and is subtitled The Fence to distinguish it from other studies by C\u00e9zanne and by other artists - including Van Gogh, who painted his Portrait of Dr Gachet there; this latter holds the world's auction-price record but has also been stolen."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/03/helencarter", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:58Z", "webTitle": "Gay couple's twins denied entry to UK", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/03/helencarter", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/03/helencarter", "fields": {"bodyText": "A gay couple face a legal battle with the home office to allow their three-week old twin babies to stay in Britain after they were refused entry when they arrived at Heathrow. The babies, Aspen and Saffron Drewitt-Barlow, were conceived after Barrie Drewitt and Tony Barlow found a surrogate mother in California who was willing to carry the children after one of the couple provided the sperm and the egg came from a separate donor. But when they arrived back in Britain last week, immigration officials immediately detained the babies and their parents were questioned for more than an hour. The babies' US passports were confiscated and they were granted temporary admission to Britain for a month while the issue of their immigration status is resolved. Mr Drewitt, 32, a businessman from Danbury, Essex, said he would write to Tony Blair asking for a meeting with the home secretary, as the case appeared to be a case of discrimination against the children of gay couples. He said it had been frightening to be detained at Heathrow airport. He told the Mail on Sunday: 'They asked us if the twins needed anything and put us and the two nannies in a small interview room with no windows or air conditioning for over an hour. 'They were asking who the parents of the children were, and Tony and I said: 'We are.' They could not get their heads round that at all.' His partner, Mr Barlow, 35, told the newspaper: 'We have been told that we were very lucky to get a month. Sometimes they only give you 24 hours.' In an interview with Sky News yesterday, he said: 'It's stressful. We've been through so much before, just to get pregnant and then worrying all through the pregnancy. All we want to do is just get on with our lives.' The US supreme court names both men as the children's parents on their birth certificates, recognising them as 'parent one' and 'parent two', following a ruling. The couple said they would take the matter up with the European court of human rights if necessary. They have consulted a solicitor who has advised them that under UK law, British citizenship can only pass through a father if he is married to a baby's mother. If either of the men had adopted the babies, then they would have automatically gained British citizenship. A home office spokeswoman said: 'As a general principle we will be looking at what is best for the children consistent with UK law and what precedent will be set.' The couple have the option of asking Jack Straw to allow the babies to stay in Britain indefinitely. Under British law, the surrogate mother is still the legal parent. If the babies are refused entry to Britain, they may be forced to return to the United States to make an application for entry clearance at a British embassy, which would mean the children would remain American nationals, but would be allowed to live in Britain. Or the couple could apply to adopt the babies and ask officials to extend the length of their stay while the adoption process takes place. But the spokeswoman said the home secretary would be wary of setting a precedent that could then be applied to other child immigration cases. She added: 'We want to consider this case very carefully. With any case that raises unprecedented issues we would want to be careful to consider the implications.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "education/2000/jan/03/teaching.schools", "type": "article", "sectionId": "education", "sectionName": "Education", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:58Z", "webTitle": "Constant criticism upsets teachers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2000/jan/03/teaching.schools", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/education/2000/jan/03/teaching.schools", "fields": {"bodyText": "Most primary teachers say they feel demoralised, overworked and undervalued, but are sustained by the love of working with children, according to a survey published today by the National Union of Teachers. About 97% of teachers surveyed regarded the children as a positive aspect of their jobs. Nearly one in five mentioned time spent on after-school activities with pupils as an enjoyable part of the work. The survey of 168 teachers in England and Wales found that most felt the biggest pressure, after the paperwork, was implementation of the government's initiatives. They wanted more time out of the classroom for paperwork and lesson preparation. According to the union, few primary teachers are entitled to 'non-contact' time in working hours; a small number get up to 30 minutes a week. More than a quarter of those surveyed felt inspections from the office for standards in education (Ofsted) and 'constant criticism' were the biggest pressures. One teacher with 30 years' experience said: 'Good teachers never make a child feel inadequate, but good teachers are made to feel inadequate every day of their teaching lives, with 'must try harder' on every end of term report.' Another said she was 'deflated and disheartened, due to regular insults and negative comments towards the teaching profession'. A male teacher with 20 years' experience said: 'Get off our backs and allow our own professional judgment and expertise to get the best from our children.' A female colleague, with a similar length of service, said: 'We are open to the recent changes, but need more time to take initiatives on board before more changes are made.' More government funding was cited by more than one in three as the single change that would do most to improve standards in schools. In other comments, there was clear opposition to performance-related pay in schools, due to be implemented this year. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the NUT, said: 'This snapshot shows a profession which cares about the future of its children, even though, personally, teachers feel demoralised, devalued and dispirited. There are many lessons here which the government should heed. Teachers do not resist change unless they perceive it to be against the interests of pupils. 'They want change to be evaluated and its impact audited before being introduced. They will take on extra work even though it may push them to the limits, if they believe it's for the benefit of children.' Most teachers of English, maths and science say the national tests at 14 do not motivate children or accurately measure their achievements, a survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers finds. More than six in 10 teachers surveyed said the tests dominated their teaching. Of English teachers, more than seven in 10 said the tests did not allow pupils the chance to shine. Peter Smith, the union's general secretary, said: 'The culture of constant testing is a real turnoff for young people. Many enter the year in which they'll sit the tests with dread.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/03/2", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:06:58Z", "webTitle": "In Brief", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/03/2", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/03/2", "fields": {"bodyText": "Woman held over deserted boy Scotland Yard last night arrested a 24-year-old woman after an 18-month-old boy was found in a tower block minutes before midnight on millennium eve.

Wooed by its luscious variety of textures, flavours and colours, she chose a career in restaurants, first as a waitress and later as a chef. Jobs in high-profile establishments such as London's L'Escargot nurtured this love, and five years ago she decided to become a self- employed caterer. Prestigious contracts to provide food for events such as London Fashion Week followed. Then Greenpeace asked her to cook for them. 'I can only describe what happened as a road-to-Damascus conversion. My first thought when I got the Greenpeace contract was that they would look good on my client list. I had always thought of food in terms of its gorgeousness - how much olive oil you could throw at a dish, that sort of thing.' Towards the end of 1996, Greenpeace environmental campaigners were involved in blockading the port of Liverpool to prevent the first genetically modified crops coming into the UK. 'I decided to find out a bit more about why they were doing this, and read an article in Guardian Weekend about the possibilities of growing oranges in Scotland and mange tout in Manchester if these foods were genetically modified to flourish in an alien climate. At first, having been brought up in an age of scientific discoveries, I thought wow, but by the end of the article I was saying, 'Oh, my God, what would that mean for countries in east Africa who have moved away from what they used to grow traditionally so they could have an export crop?' 'It suddenly occurred to me that I couldn't let these Greenpeace campaigners blockade while I just cooked their lunch. I felt that if I didn't make a stand too there would be nothing left to cook with.' What she describes as 'a steep learning curve' followed.

Like your own editor, we were stuck at a Stratford tube reception point, ticketless of course, until, in a sequence worthy of an Ealing comedy, we were herded on to a fleet of coaches and driven through the Blackwall tunnel with a police escort. We arrived at 10.40pm, by which time food and drink were long gone, and were among thousands still finding their seats, whilst the unfortunate singers on stage attempted to perform. The atmosphere up to and beyond midnight was ruined, and the only person sharp enough to refer to this immense cock-up was Stephen Fry, who was being blamed the next day by Michael Grade for messing up the timings for the show. My grievance is not that this happened - the Dunkirk spirit was alive and well on the Greenwich peninsula, that night, and we had paid nothing for our tickets. What galled me was the duplicity emanating from the New Millennium Experience people, represented by Jenny Page, and from the government, represented by Chris Smith, in the 48 hours before. Both gave groundless assurances that it would be all right on the night, and seemed more concerned to spin than react. Our conclusion was that the ruin of most of the audience's millennial night meant nothing to `the shareholder', so long as it all looked OK on television, and some heavy hitters could be wheeled out the next day to call black white. In the shambles of this public-private initiative lies another confirmation that the public department is often unable to meet its brief.

Best is the body zone - a witty take on the sounds and textures inside the body - but it's over too soon and the queue to get in a mile long. The mind zone is aimed at the mindless. Most people collected around the football video replay in the hope of seeing some real action. Worse is the faith zone which fails to rise above noisy, text-based displays before offering an uninspired chance to write down your addled hopes on slips of paper in what feels like a high-tech betting shop. Other zones invite superficial involvement (often via push buttons - oh, the new technology!), while avoiding anything unexpected or, whisper it, controversial. The rest is so universally obvious and unchallenging that the whole barely counts as an 'experience' at all. The Dome is a politician's vision of issue-free `edutainment' to keep us active but disengaged while they set about planning the future unencumbered by our input.

Two hours after midnight, hundreds of thousands of people were trudging through the streets looking for a way to get home. The buses and tubes were barely running. Far from being a festive spirit, the scenes were reminiscent of refugees evacuating a war-time European capital. The only revellers were pockets of intimidating drunks, shouting nationalist songs. The rest of us trudged exhausted, sodden with rain, hungry columns of people denied transport and access to restaurants and hotels, which were hunkered down in fear of violence. Children were in tears; the elderly, propped up by relatives. Elegantly dressed women had to squat and urinate in shop doorways because there were no facilities. The fireworks carried no message and the wall of fire did not exist. Humphrey Hawksley London Hwhawksley@cs.com Having read that the first beacon would be lit by laser at Tower Bridge and begin the river of fire, I thought it would be a good place to be. But the police had cordoned off so much of the area I could not even see Tower Bridge, let alone the Thames. We didn't have any indication when midnight occurred. No TV projection; not one speaker playing Big Ben's chimes. Just people checking their watches. So when the new year arrived ... nothing. A little later the fireworks started and were fun, but I just had the feeling - `Is that really it?' Alan Potter Loughton The fireworks were great. But crowd management at the South Bank was a shambles. The only criterion for a successful operation appears to be that no one died. Some aspiration. The organisers should study the way our village runs its jumble sales. Entrances and exits are always carefully designated and the toilets are clearly signed. Contrast that with the free-for-all by the Thames. My wife and I eventually stumbled across a mass of Portaloos under Waterloo Bridge, but never saw a single signpost. The police's single tactic was the barricade. It is obviously necessary to restrict the flow of people at sensitive points, but there was no attempt to inform the crowd as to what was happening. Several times we were caught in a crush of people attempting to reach Waterloo station, only to be met head-on by another crowd swarming back from the barred entrance. I am grateful so many officers gave up their leave to police the capital, but surely crowd management should be concerned with managing information and people, not just with herding cattle. Martin Thomas Upper Hale The real scandal was the lack of public loos. Reminiscences of the great night are dominated by tales of heroic bladder control as men and especially women sought in vain for a toilet.

In remarks which were immediately condemned by Labour, the shadow foreign secretary John Maples, called on the government to moderate its criticism of the Russians despite their ferocious bombardment of the Chechen capital Grozny. Speaking on Sky News, Mr Maples said: \"We ought to be careful of the tone in which we criticise the Russians because there is nothing we can do about it. The Russians are set upon the policy they are pursuing. The sooner they are successful, the better.\" Mr Maples added that reports of chemical weapons being used by the Chechen rebels showed that the conflict would be brutal. \"All the west can do is try to persuade the Russians to seek a negotiated settlement... and to do whatever we can to alleviate the suffering of refugees,\" Mr Maples said. Labour seized on the latest Tory blunder, which appeared to endorse the Russian assault on Grozny, even though it has been condemned worldwide. Gerald Kaufman, a former shadow foreign secretary, dismissed Mr Maples' remarks. \"It is fortunate that the views of the Conservative party do not count for anything. If they did, the thoughtless statement by John Maples could do serious damage to international efforts to bring the fighting to an end,\" he said. \"It sounds as though he believes the only course of action is a victory by arms. That is not the policy of the United Nations, that is not the policy of the United Kingdom and it should not be the policy of any responsible politician.\" A Tory spokesman insisted last night that Mr Maples stood by his remarks. Tories also pointed out that no minister had responded to Mr Maples because he had spoken the uncomfortable truth. However, Mr Maples's indelicate use of language is likely to raise questions about his future in the shadow cabinet. He is seen as one of the weakest members of Mr Hague's frontbench team and could be eased out later this year to make way for Michael Portillo. Mr Maples's blunder came as Steven Norris added his voice to the growing band of Tory heavyweights who have called on Mr Hague to avoid a lurch to the right. Mr Norris, the frontrunner to win the Tory nomination for the London mayoral election, said Mr Hague should steer clear of \"cheap cheers\" which alienate mainstream voters. \"It is natural for parties to want to regress to what they regard as their heartlands,\" Mr Norris told Radio 4's World This Weekend. \"I think that is a temptation which has to be avoided. You get a great cheer at your party conference but you will be addressing an ever-diminishing audience.\" \"If the Tories were to move back to a hardline, rightwing, law and order party that was nationalistic, antipathetic to minorities and so on then it might appeal to a very small section of the population. \"But it will never appeal to the 40% of the population it needs if it is to win power.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "technology/2000/jan/03/y2k.internationalnews", "type": "article", "sectionId": "technology", "sectionName": "Technology", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:07:02Z", "webTitle": "Chaos theory proves unfounded - for now", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2000/jan/03/y2k.internationalnews", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/technology/2000/jan/03/y2k.internationalnews", "fields": {"bodyText": "Many of the world's busiest financial markets will open for business today providing arguably the sternest test yet for the estimated \u00a3360bn immunisation against the millennium bug. While the worst fears of planes dropping from skies and nuclear meltdown appear to have been avoided, experts said many undiscovered problems could be lurking in wait for people returning to work. Some suggested that as little as 10% of the problems related to the millennium bug will surface in the first two weeks of the year. Bill Gates, the head of Microsoft, the world's largest software company, said that small businesses and any organisation using older computer systems could still face bug-related problems in the weeks ahead. 'There are lots of snafus that we haven't seen yet. There is still a little bit of a mess there that will have to be cleaned up.' The date February 29 2000 has been identified as a potential trouble spot. Financial markets in Tokyo, New York and most European cities were yesterday undergoing dummy runs of their vast computer networks as final preparation for the first day's trading of the millennium. Only minor problems, including glitches in the trading systems of 12 Japanese brokerages, emerged but the real test will come as millions of financial staff begin real work. Margaret Draper, at the US Securities Industry Association, said: 'There have been no glitches or significant Y2K-related problems and we expect to start business as usual first thing in the morning.' Paris, Berlin and Milan made similar reports. In London, which has another day off, around 60,000 staff were drafted in at the weekend to watch for trouble and run final tests. One investment banker who had brought in books and videos to keep himself busy said that dress rehearsals had been running hitch free since the summer. The Financial Services Authority, which is operating a 24-hour millennium office, reported no problems with the banking system. Cash machines are working as normal while gas, water, electricity and telecommunications passed into 2000 without interuption. The ministry of agriculture said food retailers would open today as usual and that stock ordering systems and deliveries were working smoothly. Robin Guenier, director of the independent watchdog Taskforce 2000, said he was cautiously optimistic. 'It is not by any means just about the date rollover but that having gone smoothly is a pretty good indicator. We will learn a lot from what happens in the US financial markets today.' The London stock exchange, which reopens tomorrow, was yesterday making sure that links to around 200 broking firms and data providers such as Reuters were running smoothly. Reports from around the world suggested remarkably few instances of the bug biting, certainly nothing near the epidemic some had feared as a result of some computers recognising the digits 00 as 1900 instead of 2000. There was disquiet among some businesses that the bill for tuning up their computer systems could have been avoided. However, John Koskinen, chairman of the US president's council of Y2K conversion, said that the sum, spent on preventing problems, estimated by the government at $100bn (\u00a362.5bn) and by private analysts as much more, was important because of the US dependence on computers. The government reported a problem with a spy satellite on Friday night. The satellite was put out of action for a few hours but was working on reduced capacity by Saturday. The British government has spent \u00a3430m on updating systems in the public sector. Mike Granatt, of the government's millennium office, said: 'There were very real problems which needed to be addressed. Things don't go right by accident.' Among the minor glitches was the failure of heart monitoring equipment in three Swedish hospitals understood to be millennium bug related. In Japan, computer malfunctions at two nuclear power plants, one confirmed as bug related, have been cleared up and did not affect safety or power generation, the company said. Italy, internationally chastised for doing too little preparation, hailed the lack of problems as a vindication. 'Millennium bug fears were swept away thanks to our excellent preparation and organization,' said Francesco Rutelli, the mayor of Rome. Paddy Tipping, minister with responsibility for the millennium bug, said the government's investment had been well spent. 'We have had a good millennium, but January 4 could be a critical day, when businesses go back to work. 'We may see some small businesses who have not prepared lose some information.' Stock markets in Australia, New Zealand, Israel and Thailand said systems had been given the all clear, while some smaller markets, including Cairo and Kuwait, were open for business and reported no problems."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "media/2000/jan/03/bbc.millennium1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "media", "sectionName": "Media", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:07:02Z", "webTitle": "BBC wins Big Ben ratings battle", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jan/03/bbc.millennium1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jan/03/bbc.millennium1", "fields": {"bodyText": "As with all landmark events, so it was with the turn of the millennium: Britain turned to the BBC.

Four million heard Big Ben bong with Trevor McDonald and the ITN team on ITV, while the rest were divided between the other channels.

ITV was magnanimous in defeat. 'At moments of national significance, it's right that the BBC, as national broadcaster, should be pre-eminent,' said a spokeswoman. ITV had not tried to compete, she added. Instead it provided alternative entertainment for people who wanted something different.

While the Chechen president, Aslan Maskhadov, delivered a new year appeal for an end to Russian 'barbarism' and announced that the Chechens were launching a full-scale guerrilla war, the Russians sent wave after wave of bombers over Grozny and said that they had captured strategic heights in the mountainous south of the breakaway republic. The Russian prime minister, Vladimir Putin, used the first full day of his acting presidency, following Boris Yeltsin's dramatic resignation on New Year's Eve, to make a lightning visit to Russian troops in occupied Chechnya, handing out medals, hunting knives - and tough rhetoric. Reports from Grozny spoke of dozens of air strikes on the city as well as hundreds of shells raining down. The Russians said they had broken through rebel positions two miles from the city centre - but there was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in Moscow's campaign to capture the Chechen capital. 'We have no intention of liberating anything by acting hastily,' Mr Putin said. 'We plan to act in the best possible way, which means as few losses as possible among our servicemen and no losses among the civilian population.' Mr Putin, who was told on Saturday by the US president, Bill Clinton, that Russo-American relations were 'off to a good start' in the post-Yeltsin era, reasserted that 'everything we have done so far [in Chechnya] has been justified'. But while the civilian casualty toll in Grozny was unclear, the number of Russian deaths is mounting. Since August, when Mr Putin became prime minister and the conflict erupted in Dagestan, neighbouring Chechnya, the Russians have lost 550 men. That is the official figure - but the Association of Soldiers' Mothers' Committees says the real death toll is three times as high. Every day this week, the military hospital at Mozdok has been taking delivery of about 30 severely wounded Russian soldiers from Grozny. Russian military sources alleged, not for the first time, that the rebels in Grozny were using chemical weapons. A green cloud of toxic gases, formed by chlorine and ammonia, was billowing over the east of the city, the Russians claimed. The Chechens were said to be igniting storage tanks filled with chemicals to slow down the Russian advance. Fierce fighting raged all weekend in the mountainous south, where resistance is strongest and where the guerrillas have their main shelters. The Russians said they flew 100 sorties over the region. The Chechens said they beat back a Russian attempt to take the village of Duba-Yurt. The Russians reported a big battle at Serzhen-Yurt and said they took control of a strategic position overlooking Vedeno, the base of the Islamist guerrilla commander, Shamil Basayev. 'Never again in the 21st century should any state or nation have the right to murder another people.

Amid widespread criticism of the delays, which marred the event for many specially-invited guests, the minister responsible for the dome blamed \"management problems\". \"It should never have taken as long as it did,\" the cabinet office minister, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, said. \"I really apologise to all those people, both VIPs and ordinary people, left waiting.\" His remarks came as the royal family and political leaders took the spiritual lead in ecumenical services around the country. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh joined the prime minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie at St Paul's cathedral in London, where the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, urged the congregation to remember the Christian values of love and faith in God. The religious services were overshadowed by the continuing fallout over delays at the dome which prompted Greg Dyke, the new director-general of the BBC, to complain to ministers after waiting for three hours at Stratford station, in east London. Lord Falconer did not apportion blame for the delays, but the finger was being pointed last night at the Metropolitan police which placed only one x-ray machine at Stratford station, where many of the dome's 10,500 guests passed through security checks. The mistake by the police compounded the earlier one by the New Millennium Experience Company which failed to mail out thousands of tickets for the opening ceremony on time. Guests who queued for hours for their tickets were then faced by another long queue to pass through the airport-style security system. Lord Falconer insisted last night that the delays had not marred the dome's opening ceremony. \"There were glitches round the edges but the central achievement was very impressive,\" he said. \"In many respects it was the best in the world. People at the dome were united - they were spirited, interested and humorous.\" Lord Falconer joined Mr Blair for yesterday's service at St Paul's, where they heard readings from Bunyan and TS Eliot by the actors Patricia Hodge and Richard Griffiths.

Richard Rogers has made a stunning architectural statement, matched by an equally impressive feat of engineering. To have constructed it to an unbreakable deadline and on budget was a considerable achievement. But, oh dear, the millennial show that opened it! You could not quarrel with the spectacle - the aerial acrobats, the indoor fireworks, the carnival dancing. They were indeed spectacular and made full use of the building's cathedral height and space. But what preceded it was vapid stuff. A thousand years of British culture? Let the mind feast on Shakespeare, Chaucer, Milton, Dickens, Paine, Mill, Auden, Pinter, Burns, Dylan Thomas, Wilfred Owen, Wordsworth and Keats. Let the ear revel in Byrd, Purcell, Elgar, Gilbert and Sullivan, Walton, Macmillan, Birtwistle and Benjamin. The eye could roam over Turner, Constable, Brunel, Norman Foster, Freud, Bacon, Inigo Jones, David Lean, Chris Ofili, Gainsborough and Capability Brown. We have all read enough millennial lists over the past month to double, treble and trump those names. What did we get? An Overture to The Dome, not by Birtwistle but by Jools Holland. A new piece To the Millennium not by Maxwell Davies but by a theatre composer called Jonathan Dove. A new royal fanfare by - wait for it - Richard Morris, who is apparently a commissioner of English Heritage. Holst, Britten and Handel got brief soundbites but Mick Hucknall topped the bill. A piece by John Tavener was confusingly squeezed in between Her Majesty and Auld Lang Syne. The Archbishop of Canterbury said a limp prayer and Stephen Fry cracked a joke about stroking little boys. You could not imagine the French or the Italians putting on such a show. There was something almost narcissistic in its amnesia. New Dome, New Millennium, New Labour, New Britain! Celebrate the brave new world and quietly bury the old. Think not of culture but the taste of the prime-time audience. Toast the e-future, sponsored by BSkyB and the Sun. Hand out damehoods to Julie, Shirley and Elizabeth. Arise Sir Norman! The prime minister reads history, even if he makes almost a fetish of the future over the past. But he leads an administration that many think borders on the Philistine. That should worry him, even if only because of the value of culture to education. Children watching the bland trickle on the 'One Amazing Night' could be forgiven for thinking Jools Holland represented the epitome of British musicianship and that we were a nation with no tradition of using words, paint, film, landscape or brick. Mr Blair can take the credit for promoting the Dome, but he should be alarmed by its potent as symbol for New Labour.

Good nature and a determination to have fun took the sting out of most of the worst moments, including scary crushes and tearful, exhausted queues as too many people - from an estimated 3m - tried to do the same thing at the same time. Deep wells of stoicism also came to the rescue, especially when a murk-hidden Concorde saluted the finally turning (but apparently still motionless) millennium wheel to countless, deeply satisfied comments of: \"Isn't this so British?\" Three people died - two heart attacks and an accidental drowning - but the toll and the 99 arrests were down on a conventional London New Year's Eve. Scotland Yard praised the \"fantastic, calming effect\" of the crowd's huge age range, with thousands of families bringing children and grandparents and a palpable sense of wanting others in the throng to have a good time. Champagne-clutching strangers carefully sidestepped a woman in a wheelchair and a man with white sticks at Blackfriars, and a huge reveller at the sphinx took off his millennium top hat and crouched down so that twins Peter and Kylie O'Neill from Bristol could watch for the river of fire (albeit in vain). Tempers did snap at a number of almost disastrous bottlenecks, with fighting at the Temple Embankment at 9.30pm and fury at a two-hour going-home jam between the Hayward Gallery and nearby Waterloo. Large groups also caused unintentional chaos, but other potential disasters brought out the best in the crowd. \"It was frightening but amazing, both at the same time,\" said Patsy Hayes, a Bradford primary school teacher whose teenage nephew fainted in the crush in Trafalgar Square just before the weight of numbers stove in the front window of a chemist's shop. Glass fragments came down on her 10-year-old daughter Rosie, but a group of unknown lads instinctively formed a human shield. Chivalry \"They just flung up their arms to stop the big bits of plate glass,\" said Mrs Hayes. \"They got cut themselves, but what they did was typical of the positive feeling all night - you were scared but you felt you'd be looked-after and all right.\" Her shouts of \"Man down! Help!\" immediately brought a bottle of Appletize over the heads of the crowd to revive her nephew, followed within seconds by three police. Appletize was a rarity on a night which saw champagne bottles form an estimated 15% of the rubbish cleared on New Year's Day by 150 staff with 13 dustcarts and 18 mechanical sweepers on the Embankment alone. By 1am, a child pretending to tightrope along the gutter between the ministry of defence and the National Liberal Club would have been able to do so entirely on empty bottles, almost all champagne. Misery and comfort Drunkenness featured heavily in the arrests - 6% down on the same night in central London last year - but prompted more of a muzzy sense of bonhomie than laddish bullying. Youths who had been drinking heavily (between incoherent mobile phone calls to everyone they could think of) were instrumental in rapidly getting three police to an elderly man who collapsed at the end of Whitehall Place. There was criticism, however, of police tactics on the South Bank after Big Ben's chimes, inaudible even within 200 yards because of the cheers, whistles and a special toneless millennium horn available in job-lots from street-vendors. Brian Westra, whose family had come from Holland to see the river of fire, said that he was astonished to see mounted officers ride into a crush by Waterloo, terrifying a nine-year-old girl when one officer hit revellers who didn't move out of the way. The line between misery in a crush and comfort in a quiet oasis depended partly on luck and partly on local knowledge. At 11.30pm, scrambling through shrubbery took you from a packed, choking street off the Strand into Embankment Gardens, where families sat on uncrowded lawns like a Sunday school outing, apart from the dark and the champagne. Drink is thought to have been behind the drowning of a 23-year-old man whose body was recovered from the Thames at low tide yesterday, after one of his friends was rescued at Lambeth bridge soon after midnight. Two men died of heart attacks in York Road on the South Bank, where some of the worst crushes took place as people queued to catch trains home. A short distance up the Thames, St Thomas's hospital took 200 minor casualties after midnight and the London ambulance service had 2,300 calls in the first six hours of New Year's Day. The virtual lavatory-free zone along both riverbanks in central London was blamed for a significant number of collapses, and the stench from countless impromptu urinals was the authentic millennial smell. Underwritten by a drinks firm, the free Tube service home also had hiccups, but by 3am few had the energy to do more than groan weakly at news of a stranded train causing a one-station gap on the Northern Line. Thousands of partygoers ended the Great Night trekking in opposite directions along Pentonville Road, alternating between \"Is this the way to King's Cross/the Angel?\" with \"Have a happy new year\".

Two hours before midnight on Friday, Sir Paul was briefed about a warning that a bomb had been planted in the dome. It differed from other hoaxes in the run up to the new year because a code word was used. But the word was not familiar to anti-terrorist officers, leaving them fairly convinced that it was a bluff. MI5 confirmed to the Met's assistant commissioner, Ian Johnston, who was in charge of policing on the night, that there was no intelligence to suggest groups opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process had planted a device. Mr Johnston's assessment was that the celebrations should go ahead; the dome had been searched and security on site was tight. Sir Paul supported Mr Johnston's judgment. There were plans for evacuating the dome, but it would have been logistically difficult and abandoning the showpiece of the nation's celebrations would have been a complete humiliation. Downing Street described reports that Tony Blair and the Queen had insisted \"the show must go on\" despite the threat as \"rubbish\". In an open letter, the home secretary Jack Straw congratulated the Met for dealing with the \"series of bomb threats in London in the days leading up to the millennium and on the evening itself. Those threats turned out to be hoaxes, but each had to be taken seriously\". A record 6,000 officers were on the streets on Friday.

Whereas Christmas serves only to intensify the solitariness of it all - families missed, friends preoccupied - the advent of a new year brings new hope, and with it new dreams. Everything good which never happened this year may just have a better chance of happening in the next one. And if nothing else it's another year over and we are still alive - still going strong. Well, most of us, anyway. The days blend together here, all very much the same, but on New Year's Eve we were unlocked late, at 8.30am, to give the officers a lie-in. Lunch was the same as usual - boiled potatoes, steak and kidney pie - but we had exercise in the morning, rather than working or staying in our cells. The sky was fantastically blue and the sun glinted off the razor wire as we walked about in circles. The highlight of the afternoon was a millennium quiz in the small dining room. It was won on the final question: 'Which Teletubby rides a scooter?' The answer, 'Po', secured five phone cards for Grede, the Open University student. Tolerance levels were high - lots of smiling, polite nods all around. Just before lock-up at 7pm the usual round of hand shakes and exchanges of goodwill took place. So, then, to the real excitement. We were locked up alone in our cells at 7pm. I listened to my radio, tuned to Radio 4, 'the prisoner's friend', just waiting for the pips. At ten minutes to midnight every prisoner in the country must have been standing at the door to his cell, blunt instrument in hand. I clutched a coffee tin. At midnight: bedlam. Chaos. Thunderous noise. Everyone banging on their doors together. It only lasts a couple of minutes, I suppose, but it seems to go on for an age. Someone somewhere was playing music - The 1812 Overture - though it was almost drowned out by the swearing, screaming and yowling. I think there were a couple of fires somewhere, as people burned their sheets. On my first new year inside - in the early 80s - I promised myself I wouldn't do the banging. It seemed silly. 'But everybody does it,' said the man who lived in the cell next door to mine as we shuffled along in the breakfast queue. 'It's traditional,' he said. I was in a London prison at the time: all steel gantries and prison officers who wore caps with peaks slashed low over noses. It was not an environment conducive to exuberant expression, unless of course you were being dragged kicking and screaming to the punishment block. And anyway, what if this chap was winding me up? After all we weren't exactly friends. Perhaps he was getting me at it - in the hope of providing himself with a smile at the appointed time. (Him: lying in bed chuckling to the chimes of Big Ben - Me: standing by my cell door waiting for 'the banging' to start, foolishly poised to join in.) By 9 o'clock I was in bed. Sleep, dreams, respite - and then suddenly, noise - lots of noise. My eyes opened wide and stared into the darkness. I pressed the light button at the side of my watch. Twelve midnight. I threw back the bed covers and ran to the door. Pressing my ear to the cold metal I listened in awe. The whole jail was vibrating as cell doors were battered mercilessly by all manner of blunt instruments. The noise was rising to thunderous levels as men by the score joined in. With my heart pounding I rummaged blindly in a locker drawer, until my hand grasped a tin of pilchards. Within seconds I had launched my attack. Bang! Bang! Bang! Ignoring the shock to my hand and arm and using all my strength, I hammered harder. Bang! Bang! Bang! How good it felt. How liberating. How cathartic . A couple of minutes later, save for the sporadic rantings of the more seriously disturbed, it was all over. The following year I was allocated to a long-term jail where I was introduced to more exotic ways of seeing in the new year. Thus I discovered 'shrunken bread syndrome' - and its cause. Illicit homebrew. So much yeast was stolen from the kitchens during the weeks leading up to the end of the year that the bakers were only able to turn out feeble looking loaves barely half the normal size. 'Hooch parties' were all the rage in those days, and 'Hooch masters' paid handsomely for the yeast to make the alcohol. Up to 15 men at a time would squeeze into out-of-the-way cells and guzzle strange brews to their hearts content. No amount of booze could diminish the ritual door banging at midnight however. New Year's Eve 1993 was precarious. The prison officers took the 'Hooch spin' (annual universal cell search) particularly seriously that year, and confiscated 24 gallons of 'Felons' Finest' from one wing. Uproar followed. Eventually a delegation met with the wing governor and heatedly intimated that the wing might be destroyed if the booze was not returned forthwith. Clearly the message had been received, as when the wing was unlocked for evening association there in the corner of the games room, glistening with welcome, stood a wooden cart laden with every type of plastic container imaginable. The evening had been saved. (Of course cannabis users celebrated too, but their festivities tended to be rather on the quiet side, punctuated only by the odd giggling fit.) The authorities have tightened up since then however, and substance abuse of any kind is no longer tolerated. But since the mandatory drug testing programme was introduced in 1994, the use of hard drugs has escalated. (Hard drugs stay in the body's system for a shorter time and so present the smallest risk of a positive test.) Consequently, sitting in a darkened cell with a couple of cohorts sniffing burnt smack (heroin) from the foil of a sweet wrapper seems to have replaced hooch-fuelled singalongs and dope induced catatonia as the most popular method of finding release from the pain of imprisonment these days. But although some things may have changed, the end-of-year rituals remain the same. The same old resolutions are made: the gymnasium is always packed for the first week or so of the new year, but by the second week most aspiring athletes have returned to the safer state of lethargic apathy. Smokers who want to give up bravely fail to buy tobacco on purpose knowing that the prison shop is going to be closed for two weeks. This is good news to their unscrupulous chums who buy extra, knowing that after the first week they'll be able to sell roll-ups for double the normal price. It has to be said however: there seems to be no greater sense of excitement about the arrival of the year 2000 than there was about the arrival of 1999. The nation may be gripped by millennium fever but in here it's passed us by. People are disdainful of all the hype outside, resentful almost, as if it's been forced on them. On New Year's Day we had another late unlock at 9am, but when I came out five minutes later, there was no one around. People emerged slowly through out the morning. No sense of excitement. During morning exercise, I walked with Stu, who we call the Guru. We had towels draped over our heads to protect us from the cold and from a distance we probably looked like a couple of monks. I asked him: 'What d'you make of this new millennium then?'And he said: 'Millennium. What millennium?' It summed up the prevailing attitude in here. Still, a happy new year to you all. And OK, why not? I'll say it for the first time and the last: a happy new millennium to you all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "media/2000/jan/03/bbc.millennium", "type": "article", "sectionId": "media", "sectionName": "Media", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:07:03Z", "webTitle": "Let there be light entertainment as world treads into the unknown", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jan/03/bbc.millennium", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jan/03/bbc.millennium", "fields": {"bodyText": "A couple of lines, forgotten for 60 years, have been on my mind lately. 'I said to a man who stood at the gate of the year 'Give me a light that I may tread safely into the unknown'.' I doubt if anyone but a couple of queens remembers it now. George VI said it during a Christmas broadcast in 1939. We had no idea if we would reach 1940 or, more immediately, if he would reach the end of his sentence, given as he was to prolonged silences struggling with a stammer. The quotation propelled an unpretentious poetess called Minnie Haskins blinking into the light. The gate of the year was a revolving door during the BBC's live coverage of the millennium around the world, described as the biggest and most ambitious programme ever made. Everyone on earth wanted light. Nelson Mandela, walking stiff-legged and set-faced, lit a candle in his old cell. Those with money to burn frightened the night with fireworks according to their temperament. Sydney showily. Paris elegantly. Moscow economically, having a more sinister use for gunpowder. Stonehaven swung great balls of fire. Those with no money at all summoned the sun with song and dance. John Simpson, seasick and out of sync, had clearly had a bumpy five days on a tramp steamer reaching Millennium Island, the rising sun's first port of call. Only coconut crabs live there so both celebrants and TV crew had to be bussed in. One singer died on the boat and had to be briskly buried on an offshore island. The survivors refreshed themselves with a magic potion. It had a visibly cheering effect. Substantially built dancers in stout, cotton bras greeted the sun as, he translated, a young woman greets her lover. Their faces shone gold like buttered crumpets. This is Millennium Island's swan song: it is drowning from global warming. I live opposite the Millennium Dome. One day it appeared like a jellyfish washed up on the shore but recently, to my surprise, it has taken to palpitating at night, freckled with shifting spots, flushing like an octopus, which communicates with colour. The sense of a deep sea creature, defined only by light, is very strong. Professor Quatermass would have been interested. The Queen sailed down the river in the kind of boat that often passes at night, throbbing with music. As she approached, something happened which neither the BBC nor Sky seemed to notice. The Dome was clearly all of a flutter. Agitatedly, it changed its spots from orange to blue to green and, finally, flushed perfectly purple. The higher row of lights on its crown are always red but the lower row seem to flash emotion. As the Queen arrived, they threw beams of light upwards then, visibly in a tizzy, spun round repeatedly. One of the entertaining aspects of monarchy is that this is exactly how even the most self-assured react on meeting the Queen. When PG Wodehouse heard the first American jazz, he said he heard the 20th century. As you watched the samba spectacular in the Dome, you seemed to hear the 21st. After the show, a reporter stopped one dancer in skin-tight lycra saying 'Where are you from?' 'Harlesden' it replied and whirled away. In the heart of Greenwich is the church of St Alphege, Archbishop of Canterbury around the last millennium and the world's worst public speaker. Alphege was captured by Vikings, who celebrated with a feast in Greenwich. Candid to a fault, he rose to reproach them for drunkeness, using the wrong fork and various other failings of character. They beat him to death on the meridian line with bones. Some say stones. I like bones. The audience at the Dome, while not exactly bloodstained, were plied with Tesco champagne. The present archbishop kept it very brief and conciliatory. The mike caught his sotto voce advice to the children with him 'Wave to them!' In Sydney food stores farsightedly opened to help mop up the Fosters. In Britain, as no shops were open, legal commercials fervently appealed for clients who had, as they put it, tripped or fallen. I draw this to the attention of the three blokes who fell off London Bridge. The revolving door of the year reached an illuminated Hollywood sign (I am very worried about 20th Century Fox. What can we call it now?) and, last of all, Samoa, down to its last grass skirt, invoking the dawn in dance. The Samoan national anthem, according to Peter Ustinov, goes 'Well done, Samoa! Well done, Samoa!! Well done!!!'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/03/millennium.uk3", "type": "article", "sectionId": "us-news", "sectionName": "US news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T01:07:03Z", "webTitle": "River of fire that fizzled out", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/03/millennium.uk3", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/03/millennium.uk3", "fields": {"bodyText": "It was billed as a \"river of fire\", a piece of pyrotechnic wizardry that would create the illusion of water turning to fire in a wall of flame advancing at the speed of the earth's rotation from Tower Bridge to Vauxhall.

It was no less spectacular for that - the 20-minute display enthralled the million or so people jammed along the banks of the Thames, and the millions more who saw it from other vantage points around London. It was the biggest firework display in British history - and people seemed to like it. Yesterday, the event's organisers, Big Time, were putting a positive gloss on things with a statement from which they would not budge: \"The 39 tonnes of fireworks on 16 barges produced a fantastic 20 minute display.\" True enough: but what about that picture which accompanied the event's launch showing the Thames bathed in flames ... The theory went something like this. The explosives were packed onto barges 100 and 250 metres apart. A computer on the shore would send radio cues to the two operators on each barge, who would trigger detonations at an average time interval of 0.675 seconds. Each signal would send hundreds of fireworks into the air in a fan shape, appearing in the words of the organisers \"as an advancing river of fire going upstream at 650 mph\". The river of fire effect would be achieved, it was said, \"because the fireworks ascend at different angles from the barges, [so] the detonations will take place at different distances from their launch positions\". The reality was somewhat different. If you were standing on the Embankment in front of one barge, for instance, all you would have seen were the fireworks from that one, and a few on either side. Perhaps London's problem was quality of location: Sydney lit up the harbour bridge; Edinburgh had the unmatched backdrop of the castle; Paris the Eiffel Tower.

Atal Behari Vajpayee, the Indian prime minister, said: \"All the information now available with the government about the hijack and the subsequent developments makes it clear that it was an integral part of the Pakistan-backed campaign of terrorism.\" An explosion in a busy vegetable market in the heart of Indian-ruled Kashmir that killed 15 people only stoked Indian anger at Pakistan. Indian officials said the target for the crude landmine was two vehicles carrying security officials who had come to shop for vegetables in Srinagar, summer capital of India's state of Jammu and Kashmir. The state has been wracked by separatist violence from Kashmiri militants seeking independence or close union with Pakistan. India has accused Pakistan of lending military support to the militants, including in the clashes of last summer that led to sustained artillery duels, aerial dogfights that brought the two rivals to the brink of war. Kashmir already has been the source of two of the three wars between India and Pakistan. The Christmas hijack of an Indian plane by Kashmiri militants now threatens to inflame relations between Delhi and Islamabad. The Indian government was criticised at the weekend for releasing three Kashmiri extremists from jail in exchange for the freeing of the 154 hostages aboard the Indian Airlines plane. Critics say the move will embolden guerrillas in Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. In today's explosion, two security men were among those killed, who were mostly vegetable sellers. The vehicles were severely damaged. \"It was a loud explosion and next I heard cries, the dead and wounded were all around. This is the most horrible moment of my life,\" said Joginder Singh, an Indian paramilitary soldier. The landmine exploded in Batmaloo suburb around 10:30 am local time, three days after a week-long hijack crisis which had its roots in the Kashmiri conflict. Separatist guerrillas launched a rebellion against Indian rule in the heart of the bitterly disputed Kashmir valley in January 1990. More than 25,000 people have been killed in the revolt, although Indian officials said last year that militancy had been contained. The latest flare-up in the sub-continent marks the first foreign policy test for Pakistan's new military regime, led by General Pervez Musharraf, who seized power last October from prime minister Nawaz Sharif. General Musharraf is believed to be the mastermind behind last summer's infiltration of Pakistani troops into Kashmir that triggered last summer's hostilities. He seized power after Mr Sharif was forced into a humiliating climbdown by the US and withdrew Pakistani forces from Kashmir.

Sunday Business Rolls-Royce is understood to be studying plans drawn up by investment bankers for an attempt at a merger with rival aerospace engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney. The two companies held tentative talks five years ago but those came to nothing because the Rolls chairman, Sir Ralph Robins, insisted on retaining a majority interest in the proposed new group. Since then, however, strong market share gains by Rolls' successful Trent engines have convinced bankers that a deal could now be possible with the British company taking a dominant role. Notwithstanding the first 24 hours of the new year having passed with hardly any sign of the millennium bug, government ministers including Margaret Beckett urged caution, expressing fears that it might be lying dormant in computers, ready to strike as Britain returns to work this week. Mail on Sunday The stock market is expected to reach a record high this week amid growing optimism that the millennium bug has been licked and company profits will flourish in 2000. But the surge in share prices on both sides of the Atlantic could be short lived with economists predicting rate rises in the US, Britain and Germany - home of the European central bank - before the spring. IoS The Halifax predicts that the soaring house prices of recent months will ease this year as interest rate rises and the phasing out of mortgage interest relief at source damp any dangerous boom in prices.

Many of our readers found it hard to believe that on the brink of the 21st century, ordinary people in one of the world's richest societies, were still petitioning a charity in their hundreds for such basic needs as putting shoes on the feet of their children, blankets on their beds and a cooker in their kitchen. As our correspondent noted, 'any passing thought that this is somehow outdated paternalism, demeaning for all involved, is swept aside by the sheer scale of the need and distress'. A civilised society should not be allowing this to happen. A progressive government, publicly committed to ending child poverty, should long ago have abolished the social fund's loan scheme, introduced by the Tories, and restored the old grant system. But Labour still has not moved, even though it opposed the loans in opposition. That is why the FWA remains such a crucial charity and needs your support. The other three are equally worthy of support: The Fairtrade Foundation, helping third world farmers get a better deal for their produce; Ockenden International, promoting self-reliance for refugees and displaced people; and Friends for Young Deaf People, promoting a partnership between deaf and hearing people.

It was a strange confession from a man whose ancestors were probably waiting on shore to greet the Mayflower and who had compelled even Henry Kissinger to pay him the grudging tribute: 'He's as smart as I am.' Richardson's wry comment referred to the stunning impact he had made the previous year when he resigned as President Nixon's attorney general, a seismic political gesture which ensured Nixon's departure from the White House. It has never been clear if Richardson's appointment was a calculated gamble by Nixon to give his scandal-ridden administration an air of respectability or whether the president ludicrously misjudged the man he had chosen. Richardson, who has died aged 79, took over the justice department at the height of the senate investigation into the Watergate break-in. The acting director of the FBI, Patrick Gray, had already fallen on his sword for his part in the White House cover-up. Then, on April 30 1973, the president sacked his two principal aides, John Erlichman and Bob Haldeman, and his White House counsel, John Dean. He also accepted that Richard Kleindienst, the attorney general, had been stained by the scandal and must go. Within days, Kleindienst's replacement, Richardson, had decided to get to the bottom of the administration's involvement in this murky affair by selecting Archibald Cox as special prosecutor, asking him to review 'all the documentary evidence available from any source, to which he will have full access'. Unknown outside the administration at the time, the new attorney general was also confronted with unmistakable evidence that vice-president Spiro Agnew had been taking bribes for years. As Watergate erupted around him, much of the rest of his working day (often 14 hours) was spent trying to sort out the vice-presidential mess. Eventually, he persuaded Agnew not only that he must resign, but that he should accept a conviction for income tax evasion and a fine of $10,000. Richardson said later he thought this the quickest and cheapest solution, but it did not help his relations with the president. Nixon simply refused to see this key member of his cabinet. At one stage, Richardson joked privately that he might soon write a book called Situation Wanted. Matters swiftly came to a head when Alexander Butterfield revealed to senate investigators that President Nixon's Oval Office conversations had been secretly taped for years. The special prosecutor's demand to hear nine of the crucial tapes was rejected by Nixon, on the grounds of executive privilege. The White House offered to summarise the material. Cox stood firm and, on October 20, 1973, Nixon ordered Richardson to sack him and close down the special prosecutor's office. In a tense half-hour confrontation in the Oval Office (with reports flooding in of Israel's penetration into Egypt in the closing stages of the Yom Kippur war) Richardson told the president he had promised Cox full access to all the evidence. He could not obey the president's instruction and would consequently resign. 'Let it be on your head,' said Nixon. 'I'm sorry you can't put the nation's interests above your own concerns.' 'I'd like to feel,' Richardson responded icily, 'that what I'm doing is in the national interest.' Richardson's deputy, William Ruckelshaus, was then told to carry out the order. He also refused and resigned. Finally Robert Bork, the solicitor general, formally dismissed Cox, an act which an infuriated senate later avenged by refusing Bork a seat on the supreme court. Alexander Haig, the White House chief of staff, described what followed as 'the days of the firestorm'. Within 48 hours, 150,000 protest telegrams had been delivered to the White House: eventually they totalled 450,000. The heads of 17 leading colleges of law signed a petition calling for Nixon's impeachment. The press was overwhelmingly hostile and the end of Nixon's presidency was in sight. The man who tipped the balance was the polar opposite of the wheeling-dealing president. Richardson was born into one of those elite Boston families whose forebears settled New England in the 17th century. Many of his ancestors were doctors, but he opted for law because medicine was too predictable. His period at Harvard was interrupted by the war; he was one of the first to land in Normandy on D-Day. Post-war graduation with first-class honours got him a clerkship with the supreme court justice Felix Frankfurter and he moved steadily through the politico-legal landscape of US state and local government. In 1969, Nixon assigned him to the state department, where he helped keep Henry Kissinger and William Rogers from one another's throats. From there he became secretary of health and welfare, a thankless job in which he helped defuse both school desegregation and welfare reform. With this record behind him he was moved to the bureaucratic nightmare facing the secretary of defence; it was not his most glorious hour. As a smooth presenter of even a dodgy brief, he was regularly fielded by the White House to justify its illegal bombing of Cambodia to an increasingly hostile congress. Under President Ford, he served briefly as US ambassador to London and then as commerce secretary: no one else has held as many as four US cabinet posts. His final period in government, which he described as the longest and most demanding, was as head of the US delegation to the UN law of the sea conference from 1977 to 1980. It was certainly fruitful: he was credited with writing most of the resulting treaty. Voters did not warm to his reserved manner when he sought the Republican nomination for the senate from Massachusetts in 1984, and he remained in private practice as a lawyer in Washington until 1992. His wife, Anne, died in July last year. He is survived by their daughter and two sons.

He was also a pioneer in the amplification of the violin. As he put it, he 'took a cartridge off a record player, taped the crystal to the wood of my violin, attached a shielded wire and plugged it into an amp.'' He was born in Pasadena to carnival entertainers and, from the age of six, learned classical violin. At arts high school in Los Angeles, he met Terry and the pair founded the Squires doo-wop vocal group. They also wrote and sang rhythm &amp; blues, as Don &amp; Dewey. They recorded in the early 50s for the Los Angeles Spot and Shade labels, and were then signed by Art Rupe, owner of the Specialty label, for which Little Richard recorded. Between 1957-59, Don &amp; Dewey made singles which often borrowed Little Richard-style rhythms. None was a big hit, although several were later covered by others: I'm Leaving It Up To You was a 1963 hit, which was revived in 1974 by Marie and Donnie Osmond, while the Searchers featured their novelty song. Farmer John. It was while touring with the Johnny Otis review in the late 50s that Harris got his 'Sugarcane' sobriquet, from Otis himself, in recognition of his reputation as a ladies' man. In 1963-64, while with Little Richard's band, Harris played bass as well as violin and featured on the hit Bama Lama Bama Loo. As a teenager, Frank Zappa had been transfixed by Don &amp; Dewey's Soul Motion, which had been produced by Sonny Bono. So Zappa recruited Harris to provide a tough, improvisatory edge to four, mainly instrumental, albums. Harris also toured with and played on blues albums by John Mayall (Union Station) and Harvey Mandel (Choice Cuts). Harris's violin playing, said Mayall, had 'the same sort of vitality that an electric guitar has''. Harris's solo albums included Sugar Cane, which contained an affectionate classical parody, Funk And Wagner, and Fiddler On The Rock (1970) and New Violin Summit (1973) with fellow violinists Jean Luc Ponty and Michael Urbaniak. Harris made several successful European tours. He explained enthusiastic audience reaction there by saying that ''the violin is a very European instrument. Hearing it played so differently, it's a gas to them.' By 1975, reunited with Terry in LA, Don &amp; Dewey were playing oldies' shows. Some attributed his career decline to drug problems and a disinclination to tour. Recordings became infrequent, though in the early 80s, he guested on a ska album with LA punk band Tupelo Chain Sex. According to Terry, he and Harris had recently made new recordings. Harris was divorced and leaves a daughter and two sons.

Investigators who led the prosecution of Anthony Sawoniuk at the Old Bailey last April have been briefed about Konrad Kalejs, who arrived in Britain last summer and is said by Nazi hunters to be one of the most wanted war criminals still at large. Home office sources admitted yesterday it would be `a race against time'. There is nothing to stop Mr Kalejs, 86, leaving Britain before a proper assessment is made. The UK has not been asked to arrest and extradite him by another country, as in the case of the former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet. And Mr Kalejs has not committed an offence since his arrival in Britain. But with pressure mounting from British and international Jewish groups, specialists from the war crimes unit have reconvened. `Although the unit has been officially disbanded, the expertise remains,' said a home office source. `These cases can take a long time. The officers will consider whether there is enough evidence to make an arrest on the basis of the information they have. If another country requested his arrest then it would be considered in the usual way.' Officers are expected to interview Mr Kalejs within days. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday yesterday, he denied being a war criminal and said he wanted to `leave this country as soon as I can'. He added: `I have learned my lesson. The police cannot hold me. I have been hounded round the world for 15 years, and now I want to be left alone. There's no peace for me here now.' Mr Kalejs arrived in Britain from Australia six months ago and is living in Catthorpe Manor, a retirement home on the Leicestershire/Warwickshire border run by a welfare fund for Britain's Latvian community of 8,000. He checked in under a false name with his common law wife, Austra Kalnins, but she has since returned to Australia. According to the US justice department, Mr Kalejs was joint second in command of the arajs kommandos, a Latvian secret police unit that worked with the Nazis in murdering 30,000 people, mainly Jews. Mr Kalejs, who has held an Australian passport since 1957, is reported to believe that returning to Australia is his best chance of escaping prosecution. In yesterday's interview, he claimed that the allegations of war atrocities were the work of `liars and storytellers'. He said he had been conscripted into the Red Army in 1940 and then deserted. After returning to Riga to study, he had been called up to the Latvian auxiliary security police in 1942 but was too ill to serve. But documents from the Russians and Germans show he joined the arajs kommandos and was a company commander and lieutenant from July 1941 to mid-1944. Efraim Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal centre, said Mr Kalejs must not be allowed to return to Australia, where there was `no political will to put Nazi criminals on trial'. He urged the home secretary, Jack Straw, `to put him on trial or at least hold him long enough so Latvia can put him on trial.' Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said yesterday: `The Latvian government must be chased to make a decision about bringing extradition proceedings. `Allowing this man to leave Britain without the chance of facing the most serious charges against him would be an international tragedy and scandal. Any steps that can be taken by the Leicestershire police and the Met police must be taken as a matter of urgency.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/03/marktran", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T11:52:18Z", "webTitle": "Jack Straw orders deportation of suspected Nazi war criminal", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/03/marktran", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/03/marktran", "fields": {"bodyText": "Home secretary Jack Straw today ordered Konrad Kalejs to leave Britain amid a growing public clamour for the government to throw out the suspected Nazi war criminal. Mr Straw's deportation notice followed an investigation into how Kalejs who was known by Scotland Yard to be suspected of murdering thousands of Jews was allowed into Britain. Kalejs indicated at the weekend that he had seen the writing on the wall. \"I am leaving this country as soon as I can,\" Kalejs told the Mail On Sunday before the deportation notice was officially served on him, \"I have learned my lesson. The police cannot hold me,\" he said. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Jerusalem, which tracks down Nazi war criminals and traced Kalejs to Britain, immediately urged the British government to act. \"We are calling for the British to arrest (Kalejs) and put him on trial for war crimes unless there is an extradition request from Latvia,\" the centre's director, Efraim Zuroff, said. \"Britain should view this as an opportunity to achieve justice rather then as a problem that was thrust in their lap.\" The home office came under heavy criticism since it emerged that Kalejs, an 86-year-old Australian citizen who has previously been deported from Canada and the United States, has been living in a retirement home in Lutterworth, Leicestershire. In a further embarrassment to Mr Straw, the US department of justice told the Guardian it had shared information about Kalejs with the Metropolitan police, while the Yard's now disbanded war crimes unit was investigating another war crimes suspect. Like Kalejs, Harijs Svikeris was also believed to have been part of the notorious Arajs Kommando unit, which was involved in the murder of at least 30,000 people, mainly Jews. Kalejs was identified in his Canadian deportation judgment as a war criminal by Svikeris. The two men are believed to have been joint second in command of the unit. Svikeris, who lived in Milton Keynes, died before he could be prosecuted. A department of justice spokesman said: \"We shared a great deal of our Kalejs material with Scotland Yard for their use in the Svikeris investigation.\" After home office officials admitted they could do nothing to prevent Kalejs leaving Britain, it was feared that he would flee before he could be arrested. He arrived in Britain in July on an Australian passport. Under immigration regulations Kalejs is due to leave on January 6. Australia has said it would take Kalejs back.

Two reports by front-line commanders suggest that had the invasion been resisted, there could have been horrendous casualties. This is serious, as well as eye-catching. But we should not be too carried away. The reports, carefully leaked to the BBC Today programme this morning, carry a heavy whiff of crude Ministry of Defence budget politicking. What is more, both were very deliberately intended to highlight the shortcomings of the operation, as an aid to future planning. All the same, the reports reveal some damning flaws in the Kosovo campaign. The airborne forces at the sharp end of the expedition had guns which did not work properly, and had to borrow weapons from other units. They lacked night vision equipment and could not operate properly after dark. The chain of command was confused, and orders were routinely countermanded. The soldiers were inadequately briefed about their duties and legal responsibilities once they had established control of the battered province. At one level, this is confirmation that the military machine remains a blunt and blundering instrument. Forget all the hype about surgical precision, perfect discipline and split-second timing: all armies tend to make up their operations as they go along. We should remember too that the Kosovo operation was a more than usually ad hoc affair, dictated less by military considerations than by the squalid dither and confusion of Nato's political masters. Now, where once Belgrade's federal army had overseen the brutal persecution of Albanians, Nato's woefully ill-equipped and prepared troops have watched over the expulsion of 90% of the province's Serbs. The ethnic cleansing of Kosovo is all but complete. In that godawful context, the cockups of the actual invasion are a footnote. But they do raise interesting and urgent issues for military planners and analysts and, more important, will fuel the debate about defence funding. Equipping and training a modern army is screamingly expensive (ditto, with knobs on, for modern air and naval forces). The reports from Kosovo highlight just how close to the bone successive defence budget cuts have sliced. That is precisely why the reports have been leaked. Advances in military technology have added exponentially to defence costs. In the post-Cold War world, priorities and objectives are ever harder to define. It remains true that war is too important a business to be left to generals. But Kosovo, more than any other recent conflict, strongly suggests that politicians are dangerous people to be put in charge of armies.

Nasser Hussain was one of the two frontline batsmen who didn't get out to an awful shot - the other, naturally, was the very reverend Michael Vaughan. But Hussain was to blame in a deeper sense. In yesterday's Sunday Telegraph, Scyld Berry conducted a revealing round-table discussion between Hussain, Atherton, Barry Richards and Graeme Pollock, in which Hussain said that the reason the selectors chose the present batting line-up was that something had had to be done about England's top six. In fact, both last summer and in other recent series, England's top six had exactly matched that of their opponents. The weakness in the batting was the bottom five. The dropping of Mark Ramprakash\u00e6was based on a fallacy. Hussain thought it would be good for team spirit to take several beginners, and he has clearly been proved right. But he has paid a heavy price in terms of runs and wickets. In effect, he has been playing with half a team. England have made seven big individual scores, ranging from Hussain's stonewall 146 to Atherton's sparkling 71 (interesting how those two have swapped stereotypes), and every one has come from the three old stagers. In 18 innings, Hussain, Atherton and Stewart have made 776 runs at an average of 48, which is all you would have expected and a little more, especially given the way they began. It's worth looking at their scores, in chronological order: 0, 0, 0; 0, 16, 86; 108, 82, 15; 3, 70*, 28; 1, 146*, 95; 71, 15, 40. Leaving aside Mark Butcher, who is neither one thing nor the other (like his footwork a lot of the time), the rest of the batting consists of three novices, Vaughan (or his understudy, Darren Maddy), Chris Adams and Andy Flintoff. They have also played 18 innings, which look like this 33, 16, 38; 5, 1, 36; 21, 25, 42; 29, 1, 12; 24, 19, 5; 42, 10, 22. Total 381 runs - half as many as their elders and betters - at an average of 21. This too is more or less what you would have expected. The striking thing is the number of starts the young ones have made: ten times out of 18, they have reached 20, or Done the Hard Part as the coaches say. Hussain, Atherton and Stewart have managed it just nine times, but only Stewart (twice) has failed to capitalise, and he has the excuse that he is having to keep wicket. This is not to condemn Vaughan, Adams and Flintoff out of hand. Vaughan's defence is impressive, and so is Flintoff's hitting, though for a man who is fond of a pint he is easily intoxicated by his own strength. This time 10 years ago, England took a bunch of novice batsmen to the West Indies. Team spirit flowed, the runs didn't, and two promising players kept getting out between 20 and 45. Alec Stewart and Nasser Hussain made it in the end, and so should Vaughan and Flintoff. But it will be a lot easier for them if they play in a side that wins the odd Test match. Having Adams there with them, rather than Ramprakash, makes that highly improbable. Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com and Wisden Cricket Monthly.

According to documents leaked to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, supposedly secure radios could be listened into by the Serbs. Guns issued to British paratroopers did not work properly, and some had to borrow weapons from other units, the documents, drawn up by senior British commanders, suggested. Troops could not work properly after dark because they lacked sufficient quantities of night vision equipment. And one paratrooper unit had to let a suspected war criminal go free because they lacked a legal basis on which to detain him. The BBC said that the leaked documents suggested that the British forces were ill-prepared for an opposed invasion. It quoted one of the documents as saying: \"It is the view of this headquarters that had the situation on 12th June (the day of Nato's advance) been anything less than benign, there would have been command, control and communication difficulties which could not have been resolved by K-For headquarters.\" One section highlighted the unreliability of the paratroopers' guns. \"During both blank and live training for Kosovo the light support weapon proved to be both unreliable and insufficiently robust.\" On communications, the document stressed: \"Communications are essential for the success and survival of light forces. We were fortunate that an inadequate system was not put to the test.\" The Ministry of Defence issued a statement in response to the BBC's report. The MoD said that Britain and its allies were well prepared to launch a land campaign in Kosovo. And it was confident that this would have proved successful, had it been necessary to commence such a campaign. The documents displayed concerns among the military about their inability to detain war crimes suspects. \"There was much discussion about law, but little application of justice. Meanwhile the Albanian community in particular meted out violence on Serbs, sure in the knowledge that we were impotent to stop them.\" Another section in one of the documents suggested that the headquarters of K-For commander General Sir Mike Jackson was too distant from troops on the ground, leading to \"confused and fractured\" command. \"Soldiers were operating in something of a vacuum which lasted for several days. There were constantly changing orders and confusion, with a potentially damaging effect on morale. This erodes confidence and may, in extremis, place individual soldiers in an invidious position.\" Bruce George, the Labour MP for Walsall South who chairs the Commons select committee on defence, said he wanted to see action taken on the shortcomings suggested by the leaked documents. \"The documents ... have raised very interesting points. The defence committee has conducted substantive inquiries after every war, and we have already begun a very serious inquiry into the lessons to be derived from the war in Kosovo,\" said Mr George. \"The defence committee produced a report on the Strategic Defence Review and we reached the conclusion that if the Government wished to achieve its objectives, politically and militarily, then defence expenditure would have to rise beyond the rather miserable level to which it has sunk over the last 15 years. Mr George said he was disturbed about the military's inability to detain war crime suspects. \"This is not a military failure, it is a political inadequacy in which people who were undertaking peace keeping were in fact given inadequate legal tools,\" he said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the equipment failings detailed in the reports would not have damaged the success of any land campaign in Kosovo. The two reports, prepared by a lieutenant colonel and a brigadier, were designed to be as \"critical as possible\" of the armed forces' performance in the campaign, he added. They would form part of a larger review of the military action in Kosovo which will be published later this year. \"We always, after a campaign such as Kosovo, review the events as soon as possible and as critically as possible,\" said the MoD spokesman. \"These reports are two of many such reports. \"They will form part of a balanced overall picture which we will be making public when we publish a report on the campaign later this year.\" He added: \"With our 18 allies in Nato we prepared for a land campaign and were confident that this would have been successfully executed, had it been necessary. Shadow Defence Secretary Iain Duncan Smith called for a wide-ranging inquiry into the military's problems during the Kosovo conflict. Mr Duncan Smith said: \"It's very, very worrying obviously, and it's very worrying that we have to get this via a leaked report. \"The most important thing is that this was pretty much perhaps as good as it will get, because this was done on the previous budget.\" Former Liberal Democrat leader and Balkans expert Paddy Ashdown said the leaked documents suggested serious problems, but added that they contained the kind of complaints frequently voiced following a conflict. \"Well it's undoubtedly very serious and I hope it will be taken seriously. But ... I don't think I can ever remember a single campaign ... in which there were not afterwards natural and proper complaints by frontline soldiers about the inadequacy of the equipment and the staff.\" \"But it has to be put in its context. This was a highly successful operation which was brought off with great skill and courage,\" Mr Ashdown told the Today programme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/03/balkans1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T12:53:30Z", "webTitle": "Broken guns and old radios: standard issue to British soldiers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/03/balkans1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/03/balkans1", "fields": {"bodyText": "The British Army's chosen rifle is the troubled SA80, developed at the Royal Small Arms factory in Enfield. Launched to a fanfare of applause in 1985 as the modern weapon of choice for the Army, soldiers soon complained that the gun - developed at a cost of \u00a3384 million - had serious faults. In March last year, the Ministry of Defence scientists identified 'underlying problems' with the rifle. Soldiers in the Gulf complained that firing pins broke, sand jammed the mechanism, a faulty catch allowed the magazine to fall out, the trigger stuck and the bayonets fell off during training. It was even suspended from Nato's list of acceptable weapons and the faults discovered so far have cost over \u00a324 million to rectify. And it was no good for left-handers. The news that British soldiers had problems using their radio units is also not new. Soldiers in Kosovo reportedly had to borrow cellular phones from reporters there as their own communications didn't work. Most British units use the obsolete Clansman radio, developed originally in the 1960s. Its signals were, according to the reports, regularly intercepted by the Serbs. And there is no immediate solution in site: it was announced last month that, after many delays, the new \u00a32.2 billion Bowman radio system will be delayed by two years, and is scheduled to enter service in 2004 - eight years late. But even that is not the end of the saga. Because Ministry of Defence rules mean that 'acceptance' of a product is defined as use by a brigade-sized part of the army, only around 2000 people could end up using the new equipment out of 102,000 serving soldiers. It's all part of what is becoming a fine tradition of army equipment problems. A National Audit Office report in 1988 found that the military's stocktaking process was hopelessly inefficient and that millions of pounds of equipment had gone missing.

Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov claimed the Russians were suffering mounting casualties and had lost control of three villages southwest of Grozny. Moscow denied the report. Federal officials reported that Russian jets and artillery had bombed a small village in Chechnya's southern mountains, trying to block the path of retreating rebel forces. The strikes killed some 50 militants and wiped out two rebel bunkers, said Russian military spokesman major Alexander Diordiev. These death tolls could not be confirmed. During the Chechen campaign both sides have routinely exaggerated claims of losses inflicted on their opponents. RIA news agency reported today that some 80 more guerrillas had been killed in clashes around Vedeno, home base of rebel commander Shamil Basayev in the mountains south of Grozny. Only three Russian solders were killed, RIA said. Interfax news agency quoted military sources in Mozdok, Russia's main army base in the North Caucasus just outside Chechnya, as saying up to 35 rebel fighters had been killed in the latest clashes in and around Grozny. A spokeswoman for a body representing the mothers of Russian soldiers told Ekho Moskvy radio at least 1,000 federal troops had died and about 3,000 had been wounded during the military operation. The radio said the Russian defence ministry had put the number of federal troops killed until the end of November - roughly two months after the campaign started - at about 300. Acting president Vladimir Putin, propelled into the Kremlin by Boris Yeltsin's shock resignation last Friday, discussed the situation in the Russian-controlled parts of Chechnya today with Nikolai Koshman, Moscow's top representative in the war-racked province. Mr Putin wants to finish the Chechen war if possible before Russia's presidential election, set for March, which he is the favourite to win. The war is popular among Russians and forms the basis for the acting president's high opinion poll ratings. \u0095 A gunman has been shot dead in Beirut after firing grenades at the Russian embassy.

Construction workers, football hooligans, painters, decorators... the thought of cocaine-crazed white van man will bring shudders to Tunbridge Wells. No mention, however, of Freud's Cocaine Papers, Sherlock Holmes's bottle, or the Empire of the Incas, who looked upon the coca shrub as a living manifestation of divinity. Coming down from the transcendental 60s, sweet cousin cocaine whispered to me of dangerous glamour; rock gods had lines laid out on top of their amps and we all knew about Hollywood Babylon. Since then it has gone through the grim process of democratisation and become The People's Drug of the 90s. Housewives in Hampshire can now order what Tallulah Bankhead called the 'absolutely divine' from a man in the market. It's as commonplace as the mobile phones that make dealing it so easy. I suppose it's still fun, but it doesn't look like it from these programmes. Because no dealer in their right mind would go on screen and admit to possession with intent to supply Class A drugs, most interviews in Secrets And Lines (9pm, Thursday, Channel 4) are recreated by actors. Apparently the spawn of prohibition are doing very nicely, thank you, 'I could never live on the 300 quid you get for a 9-to-5 job, know what I mean?' Especially nauseating is 'high-end dealer' Johnny Mohair, played as a camp coloured man with a blond top knot, who grovels before the status of the people he sells to. 'I have a duty to respect my clients, and in return they respect me.' Who's he kidding? The token female dealer was a dodgy blonde who bore no resemblance to any of the chicks I knew who trekked up mountain pathways to bring back the best Bolivian flake. My Mate Charlie (9pm, Wednesday, Channel 4) deals with the up-tight white folk for whom a wrap of coke is a couple of phone calls away. Like Sue, looking strangely fit and tanned yet dead within, who blew her inheritance of \u00a3322,000 up her nostrils at a rate of 15 grams a day. When she'd licked the wrap and scratched at the floorboard for fallen fragments she would blow her nose and eat the tissue. 'My dealer was my only friend.' During his Thin White Duke ordeal David Bowie blew his nose and thought his brains had fallen out. He had mind enough left to know it was time to quit the Nietzschean fantasies. At least it had brought us some great music. What can 90s man Matt the Welder, on three grams a day, bring us from his less exotic nasal passages? 'Blobs of blood, and grisly bacon stuff.' His voice utters from a face of uncooked pastry, and he is so dedicated to the White Mischief that he says he won't stop until his nose falls off. A Fantastic Voyage - like journey up the inside of Matt's proboscis brought screams of terror from the younger viewers. Also in this trio of coke-fest programmes is Cocaine On The Brain (10pm, Wednesday, Channel 4), featuring bog-standard medical experts, and a young group of 'cocaine takers' who are studied during an evening's indulgence. In the late 19th century, Freud was berated for his advocacy of 'the third scourge of humanity', but his data on the effects of cocaine deserve mention as much as any thing because the person he experimented on was himself, and it's hard to improve on such methodology. 'Here we have someone who is high,' says a psychopharmacologist, indicating a woolly-hatted youth. A girl sitting by a fibre-optic light shares her inner secrets: 'You can get into things, I feel so focused... let's have another line.' The screen becomes a Tron-like playground for diagrams of neurotransmitters, pleasure zones and computer-animated arrows of activated dopamine raging round the brain. Pavlovian psycho-stimulant surges are measured by men with clipboards, inevitably followed by words of warning from the man in a blue medical gown: vasoconstriction, blood clots, death... the usual price for substance abuse. In the 1880s Dr Fleischl, brilliant physician and friend of Freud, developed cocaine poisoning after taking a gram a day over a period of time and seeing white snakes creep over his skin. Why not tell us about the various substances used to cut today's coke with? Is it glucose, lactose, novocaine, Ajax? How can we obtain quality control? Was that real coke on the mirrors? If so, they were harsh lines. Explain the difference between pharmaceutical and rock, or what happens to your lungs if you smoke it (the rumour is it crystallises). My son tells me on the club scene it's mostly smoked because the loos are carefully watched for the joy powder brigade. I wonder anxiously what toxins are coursing round his bloodstream, I know I shouldn't, but I have to ask. He tells me not to worry, but he would, wouldn't he? Who listened in the death-trip 70s, when we were told it popped your brain cells and they never grew back? I was too busy pretending I was the coke-head heroine of Aleister Crowley's Diary Of A Drug Fiend 'Her eyes glittered, her lips twittered... She was the spirit of cocaine incarnate; cocaine made flesh.' In reality I was a mess, and left town thin and broke. Perhaps a few opium dens to chill out in wouldn't go amiss. From Channel 4's trawl through the coke snorting hoi-polloi there seems to be no other answer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "media/2000/jan/03/channel4.broadcasting", "type": "article", "sectionId": "media", "sectionName": "Media", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T15:46:52Z", "webTitle": "Snow's business", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jan/03/channel4.broadcasting", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jan/03/channel4.broadcasting", "fields": {"bodyText": "On BBC1's 6 O'Clock News, poor Huw Edwards still looks like someone sentenced to reading an autocue for an unspecified anti-Birtist crime. At 9 O'Clock on the same channel, Michael Buerk and Peter Sissons are said to be sulking, convinced their bulletin has been downgraded ever since the 'Six' was relaunched. On ITV at 6.30, Sir Trevor McDonald has yet to regain the authority which News At Ten gave him. And on Channel 5, a programme built around ITV defector Kirsty Young will now have to be reconstructed. Looking across the main terrestrial bulletins, the lone vibrant exception to this pattern of misery and resentment is Channel 4 News, which has already successfully introduced a Saturday edition and next Sunday (albeit in exchange for losing 30 minutes on Fridays) becomes a seven-day operation. After a year as presenter, reporter, debate referee and celebrity interviewer, anchorman Jon Snow is raring to go. 'I've always had a genuine passion to see a serious Sunday news programme, and I think other channels have missed a trick, that there's a real appetite for something that says, 'the weekend's ending, where are we, what's happened, what's going to happen?' On Saturday, you know, we're getting the best figures of the week, 1.6m heading out to 2m, and my feeling is we could get more. In fact, I'd be disappointed if we don't get 2m.' Jim Gray, lured away from Newsnight by Michael Jackson to edit and overhaul Channel 4 News, says that he soon found that the Saturday bulletin he introduced last year needed to 'rattle along' more than he expected, but is convinced the 'more reflective, more lateral' approach that he initially planned for Saturday will work on a Sunday. Among its other defining features, he adds, will be 'a strong international perspective, investigative stories given room to breathe, and long interviews at the top of the programme.' Asked if he still sees himself as the bolshy 'enemy within' at ITN, Snow laughingly replies, 'not with Jim Gray around - I'm no longer alone. I feel very much part of Channel 4. I feel rather less part of ITN, within which Channel 4 News is a very aberrant creature, but it's ITN who pay me and I haven't worked for anyone else, except briefly in radio. So it's an odd situation, a split-personality thing.' Does the fact that the same organisation is now making bulletins for ITV at 6.30pm and Channel 4 at 7pm cause problems? 'Not really. Because of the way technology has developed, we're able to extract material at the same time. And, anyway, we and ITV are actually rarely scrabbling over the same ground. I don't think, for instance, that we covered the death of Cilla Black's husband in any great depth, but they did it for three minutes.' This is said with dry humour, but his underlying point is serious. 'I mean, ITV's got out of the business of public service broadcasting. News At Ten was a public service. There's a great swathe of people in British society who don't have the time or inclination to watch news before 10pm, and they're entitled to a channel that provides it. By moving the news, ITV have forfeited all right to be called a public service broadcaster.' What's Snow's assessment of the 6.30 bulletin? 'Well, it's 'right for its market',' he replies, grinning broadly. The BBC fares no better, with Newsnight's 11pm Scottish opt-out slated as 'a complete disgrace. In fact, the whole way the BBC has responded to Scotland is very mealy-mouthed. If even Westminster can countenance devolving power, the BBC should certainly have a devolved a 'Scottish Six' news bulletin. The fact that they didn't shows really scared thinking.' Snow has been approached to defect 'from time to time, over the years', but says 'the BBC would have to change profoundly for it to be tempting. It's far better resourced than any of us have ever dreamt of, and it would be wonderful to have all those resources to play with. But on the other hand it would be awful to put up with the stale breath of the bureaucrats who would be peering over your shoulder. 'And they do: whenever you meet your BBC counterparts, there's always something burdened about them, they've always got a shoulder sagging - and on that shoulder is the heavy arm of those endless bureaucrats. Even in Jeremy Paxman's case, there's probably four or five layers of accountants and other sorts of creature above him, whereas there's only one person between me and the boss of Channel 4, and that's Jim Gray.' Adding to his enthusiasm for the channel is the way it has belatedly begun to exploit his talents by using him for what he calls 'extra-curricular' work, such as last Thursday's On the Line programme which was Snow's own idea. Alongside the day power was devolved to Northern Ireland - beginning at Seamus Heaney's house in Dublin, and ending at Stormont - and forays to Macedonia and Kosovo, one of his personal highlights of the year was travelling to Australia to chair a rumbustious pre-referendum debate on the monarchy. 'Fantastic! I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. If you said to somebody, 'go to a country about which people [here] know nothing and care less, find 80 people nobody here's ever heard of, put them in a studio and make a good programme', they'd think you were mad. But it was wonderful, and it raised issues that are relevant here because in Britain the monarchy is rarely discussed, it's the subject that dares not speak its name.' His interview with Monica Lewinsky is not among the high points he singles out, and he freely admits it was flawed: 'I asked some very fatuous questions, like 'did [Clinton] make you tingle?', which was probably not a very wise idea, but on the other hand nothing about interviewing Mikhail Gorbachev and Margaret Thatcher prepares you for interviewing a young woman who hasn't been found in bed with the President.' Did he fail to ask obvious questions because he was too diffident, as some women profile-writers suggested? 'I might be. It's a difficult problem. You never have to interview 24-year-old women in depth, basically. And as the depths had all sorts of Freudian connotations, I felt I was treading on very, very rocky ground and could have got into really serious trouble - so the fact that I emerged only criticised for not asking more specific questions was OK. 'I've often asked myself, 'should I have done a more aggressive, make-the-woman-cry interview?' Barbara Walters did her on the same day and her ambition, which she achieved, was simply to make her cry. But I thought [in my interview] the real Monica came across, perfectly nice and rather naive. And, after all, what's your service to the viewer? It's to share some real insight about who she is. But it would have been interesting to see the difference if Paxo had also intereviewed her.' Famously dubbed 'that pinko' by Denis Thatcher, Snow is unusual among news presenters in the candour of his opinions - about ITN and ITV, for example, or about whether working journalists should accept honours from No 10 (he declined one), but also about political issues. He needs no prompting to defend this openness: 'It's important to stop imagining that there is a human being who is neutral. I don't believe it. There ain't such a thing. What you have to be is fair, to let people state their case, and be aware that the whole way you interview them is shaped by your prejudices, where you're coming from.' Is John Humphrys penning regular columns for the Sunday Times a wholly good thing, then? 'He's a much more irascible and opinionated person than I am, but yes, I believe in an open society, and the more viewers know about what you really think, the more they can form an opinion as to what it is they're being given. 'This is probably dangerous territory, but I think it also helps to know how these people live in society. Then you know where they're coming from. There are plenty of presenters with fine stock-holding portfolios and reams of privately educated children, who also come from a particular perspective but don't show their hand.' Describing the movie Broadcast News as 'full of all kinds of truths' about TV journalism, Snow relishes the 'kick bollock and scramble' it depicts, the moments when 'just getting it on air becomes more important than what gets on air' or when 'you hear through your earpiece that something's happened, and you know most of what's been planned is about to go out the window'. He also thinks that news anchors should regularly re-experience the rough-and-tumble of reporting: 'It's a problem that the sausage machine doesn't often release, people such as Trevor [McDonald] and Michael Buerk and Peter Sissons to get the old dust under their feet. And once you become removed from the journalistic process and remain in presenter mode, you begin to lose sight of what's happening.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "media/2000/jan/03/mondaymediasection.columnists", "type": "article", "sectionId": "media", "sectionName": "Media", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T15:46:52Z", "webTitle": "We don't talk any more", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jan/03/mondaymediasection.columnists", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jan/03/mondaymediasection.columnists", "fields": {"bodyText": "The late John Stradling Thomas MP was a Tory whip, but he did a brilliant Nye Bevan impression. I recall him standing perilously on a stool in Annie's Bar, reciting the whole of a Bevan speech, with the right accent, intonation, pauses and inflections. You might have been on a windswept hill above Ebbw Vale. The speech was one of Bevan's great, lovingly rehearsed turns, about how as a boy he had thought that power was in the council, then he realised it was in parliament, then on becoming an MP he discovered it was in the cabinet. Finally he found that power actually resided in Whitehall, and hence democracy was a sham. It was a funny, exhilarating performance, and I felt privileged to enjoy it even secondhand, because a good impressionist is more evocative than any amount of scratchy black-and-white film. You couldn't do that now. The audience would have gone home ages ago. Imagine any contemporary politician trying to convince the public with a long, oratorical set piece. In November last year the prime minister gave an interview to Jeremy Paxman about Ken Livingstone. He appeared half demented. His eyes bulged. He gulped. Even more disturbingly, he suddenly remembered to smile a death's-head grimace. Later I ran into Paxman and asked him what had gone wrong. He thought - and I paraphrase - that Blair was so consumed with hatred of Livingstone that his normal speech patterns were dislocated. The medium, unable to cope with the message, had imploded. That wouldn't have happened to Nye Bevan, who would have produced a speech - 'lower than vermin' or 'dessicated calculating machine' perhaps. But Tony Blair is a creature of the modern media, and speaks the language of the daytime TV studio - cosy, cuddly, warm. He hasn't got the verbal bag of tools to do hatred. The way rhetoric has changed as the media have changed is the theme of a three-part Radio 4 series I've just finished working on. We wondered whether the formal persuasive talking of the past can survive today in a world where communication is by electronic pulses rather than by ringing voices. Nothing could be less rhetorical than email, with its sparse grammar and punctuation, minimalist vocabulary and absence even of capital letters, the equivalent of a speaker's stress. It is bland and unarousing. McLuhan talked about 'hot' and 'cool' media; email is positively frozen. But rhetoric has survived. No one who has heard the Rev Ian Paisley in full flood can doubt that, nor the power his speech has over an audience. Indeed, US evangelists use all the tricks and formulae the ancient Greeks knew. Few people in a modern business organisation have escaped the motivational speech, a form of discourse which uses some of the same devices for praising capitalism that John Wesley used for praising the Lord. Lawyers still use rhetoric, in the packed intimacy of a courtroom; George Carman is the most successful exponent today. Even in politics, rhetoric is still used - though it's now almost confined to party conferences, which are the only remaining great rallies. Gladstone's Midlothian campaign couldn't happen now; we'd all be at home watching TV. Ann Widdecombe, who has taken over the job of whipping the Tories to a fervour, told us of the tricks she uses - walking about the stage, arranging physical bits of business to attract attention, and most of all performing extempore, which is hypnotic, since the audience watches fascinated to see if she dries up.

It was intellectually vacuous and rhetorically impoverished; Blair's most effective device was pounding repetition. The adjective 'new' occurred no fewer than 23 times in the Guardian's edited text of the speech. And always as what Orwell calls a 'doubleplusgood' word. 'Old' occurred just once and pejoratively. So intoxicated is Blair with the idea of newness that it is sometimes difficult to see where he's going with it. 'The New Deal,' he prophesies, 'is only the first step in a new approach to welfare and work. On its foundation, we must build a new welfare system.' Is the foundation, then, to be entirely new? No pensions, no benefits, no tax relief? The brain whirls. We are not, however, allowed to linger. There is so much other novelty to admire. There is, for example, a 'new peace in Northern Ireland'. In the regions, 'new dispensations' and 'new partnerships'. In Europe, 'new bonds of connection'. Here at home, there is oodles of newness as well. Thanks to New Labour, we have 'a new national institute of clinical excellence', '37 new hospitals' and 'thousands of new doctors'. They are raring to go. 'People,' Blair declared, 'want to see the new doctors and nurses on the wards, want the new system to tackle cancer and heart disease up and running.' If, horrible thought, you had cancer or heart disease, would you want a 'new doctor', the ink still wet on his or her diploma? Or would you want a doctor who had 30 years' clinical experience treating your condition? Clearly 1.1.2000, if ever, is a time to be out with the old and on with the new. Blair's refrain was appropriate and one should not worry about what it means any more than one should worry about what exactly 'auld lang syne' is. (Every January, I resolve to look it up.) Blair's iteration of New Deal, New Labour, New Year, New Millennium, New Systems gets his big idea across. He is dedicated to change and history is on his side. Nonetheless, most of the citizens of Blair's Britain are not new. Many, in fact, may justly be termed old. And, according to recently published figures, they can confidently expect to get older. Average life expectancies, for both men and women, are moving inexorably towards 80 and beyond. And what with all the new doctors and systems tackling those pesky degenerative diseases, those who have seen it through to the new millennium may expect to live even longer. There is a troubling blind spot in Blair's vision of New Albion. He sees no place for anything 'old' - not even old people. What to do with the superannuated and underpensioned? Park them out of sight, seems to be the PM's solution. I can only speak for my own profession. I teach in Britain and in America. In Britain, at the age of 65, I must retire. American universities, like other professional institutions, may impose no age-mandatory retirement. It's federal law. You can soldier on until you drop. Many do. On the face of it, the American system looks brutal. But in my experience that is not how it works. University teachers are no more likely to suffer late-life incompetence than barristers such as George Carman who, for all his 70 years, ran rings round the opposition in court a couple of weeks ago. (If you were defending a libel suit, would you rather have Carman or a 'new lawyer'?) Many American academics land their career-best jobs in their 60s. Old teachers are, of course, expensive. They take up space required for new recruits. And they tend, given their decades of experience, to dominate key committees. But if their (American) institution wants them out, they must make a deal. A golden handshake, in other words. It cushions retirement very nicely. The abolition of age-mandatory retirement would keep a significant number of high-earners in the tax-paying sector. It would shift the onus of pension top-up from the state to the employer. Most importantly, it would retain a valuable reservoir of expertise. Since no one registers how much of Blair's Third Way is lifted from America, he could even present it as a 'radical new reform'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "media/2000/jan/03/bbc.mondaymediasection", "type": "article", "sectionId": "media", "sectionName": "Media", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T15:46:53Z", "webTitle": "Birt's BBC u-turn", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jan/03/bbc.mondaymediasection", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jan/03/bbc.mondaymediasection", "fields": {"bodyText": "In the early hours of New Year's Eve, as the attention of the world was diverted to the approach of the next millennium, a BBC announcement revealed some truly welcome news. Indeed, at this time of over-excited pronouncements, it could be described as an historic turnaround. Elevated to the exalted position of baron in the new year's honours list, John Birt is to step down two months before his declared leaving date of the end of March. In just over three weeks, Birtism at the BBC will end when the man who has led it through the dog days of the century leaves to take up his life peerage and join the House of Lords. As Lord Birt clears his desk and vacates the open-plan office he has shared with his successor Greg Dyke for the last three months, the nods and winks of those close to the DG-in-waiting who have persisted in suggesting that Birt would see in the new year and elegantly depart seem more prescient than hopeless. Through all the speculation, urging and at times ungracious insistance that Birt must go and leave Dyke in peace, the director-general remained at least on the surface resolute. Sadly we can only guess at the behind the scenes manoeuvring that the neatness of his u-turn implies. What were the terms of the trade-off? Did Dyke make clear the untenable nature of his position? Did Sir John self-sacrificingly lay down his sword and his last 60 days of power for an extra \u00a35 on the licence fee? Did it involve a mandatory appearance at the dome? In Cambridge, at the Royal Television Society convention, he was adamant he would see out the entire six-month handover period, unconvincingly arguing that Dyke would need all the assistance he could give. Echoing the Queen, by publicly refusing to countenance abdication, though the successor may wish it with all his heart and the public might believe it to be inevitable, Sir John was not for moving. Even when, after the conference, briefings from government suggested a solution involving elevation and grandeur might be acceptable, his position remained firm. It would have been unseemly, of course, for Lord Birt to rush straight from the editorial impartiality of the BBC into a Labour whip in the Lords. Unseemly and unnecessarily provocative for a Tory party sufficiently beleaguered to make further accusations of bias at the Beeb all too inevitable. He will sit on the cross benches (as revealed by this paper last year) where, we may fondly hope, he will soon be provoked into some stirring attacks on his former policies, much as Duke Hussey so eloquently turned on his former protege in a debate on the future of public service broadcasting last year. There will be much to concern him. A broadcasting act seems certain to be scheduled early in the next parliament. Birt's understanding of digital television will hopefully help the politicians' loose grasp of the technology. Perhaps during his maiden speech, the remaining slumbering Lords will be treated to a Birt special; complete with overhead projector, bullet points and clips from the costume drama du jour. Followed naturally by a thorough background briefing (or translation) from a team of corporate press officers. If the new year cannot be guaranteed to bring the BBC a substantial slug of digital licence fee income to the tune of the \u00a3700m it has requested, then at least the government can claim to have performed this small miracle, of contriving a happy and graceful solution to the never justifiable two leaders in one office dilemma. Should the now widely predicted across the board increase in the licence fee replace Gavyn Davies' digital supplement and finally materialise before the end of January, Dyke will be able to take over in February with the minimum of conflict. It's probably the best solution broadcasting could have hoped from the government. More gratifying than the well-deserved OBE to media hack Ray Snoddy for services to explaining convergence to politicians, more satisfying somehow than ITN chief executive Stewart Purvis's CBE for struggling valiantly against the move of News at Ten and certainly more edifying than the CBE to News Corporation's chief spin doctor, Jane Reed, for services to creating a better image for Rupert Murdoch. If Lord Birt seems to have shown, in this his last roll of the corporate dice, a rash determination to stay on till the final curtain, his reward should be that he considers himself amply recompensed by the government with a fancy costume and the chance to make a suitably damning condemnation of his enemies. Perhaps it's just because it's the panto season, but the picture of Baron not-so-Hard-Up strutting his ermine-clad stuff in the Lords should gladden even the least forgiving of his detractors' hearts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "media/2000/jan/03/pressandpublishing.mondaymediasection1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "media", "sectionName": "Media", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T15:47:55Z", "webTitle": "The latest Tory defector", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jan/03/pressandpublishing.mondaymediasection1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jan/03/pressandpublishing.mondaymediasection1", "fields": {"bodyText": "The Tories have been having such rotten luck recently that you almost feel sorry for them. For months now, their media managers have had about as much trouble generating a positive headline as Neil Hamilton's barrister had getting a word in edgeways with Mohamed Al Fayed. Some elements of the recent run of desperately unhelpful headlines - such as those spawned by the disaster-courting dishonourable former member for Tatton - were the result of a bumper harvest of bad apples, and can hardly be blamed on the luckless party leadership. But in so many day-to-day issues of general political policy, the Tories are constantly coming nowhere in the race for a positive spin on the front pages - even in those papers on whose support it could traditionally count. So when they managed to secure the (unpaid) services of 15 eminent economists to serve on an advisory panel for the beleaguered Tory high command, it was rightly seen as something of a coup. But inept handling of the announcement by a junior party official turned what should have been a minor victory into a major defeat, precipitating the resignation of a prominent member of the committee on the day his appointment was announced. It was yet another Tory fiasco. The 15 names on the Conservative press release were, to most journalists, impressive-sounding but unknown. One name, however, stood out - that of the US economist, Irwin Stelzer. Any mention of Stelzer's name in a British political context always pricks the attention of Westminster-watchers, for Stelzer is not simply the director of a prominent Washington free market-oriented think tank, but one of the few close confidants of a certain Rupert Murdoch. Stelzer, who has known and advised Murdoch for over 20 years, writes columns in the Murdoch-owned New York Post and Sunday Times and is a super-lobbyist on behalf of the media magnet. Almost anywhere around the world where a big Murdoch deal is being pulled off Stelzer's name will not be far from the action. He has been called Murdoch's secret agent. It was doubly interesting that Stelzer should be associated now with the Tories. He is an admirer of Gordon Brown, and a frequent visitor to Downing Street. He is also a staunch Thatcherite who has little time for the political and economic fudges that have stalked the Conservatives since her departure. Murdoch's stable of newspapers has broadly abandoned the Tories, having given themselves up to the prevailing new Labour wind. Stelzer was in on the whole process - reportedly party to a secret, and always-denied deal done between Murdoch and Blair in which the Sun's support for new Labour was guaranteed, provided Blair backed off from outright support of the single currency in the short term. It was a stroke of unseasonal bad luck which made the welcoming of a Murdoch confidant into the bossom of the Conservatives a new year banana skin. The former chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, had chosen the same day to launch a vicious broadside against the current leadership, and much of the Westminster press gallery was in Tory meltdown (again) mode. But it was the middle of the holiday period and most publications were operating on skeleton rotas - meaning that Stelzer's appointment, although interesting to the hacks, was surely seen as something of a low priority. But at the Financial Times political desk Cathy Newman's interest was aroused. Perhaps it was her background in media matters - until recently, she was the FT's media correspondent - but whatever the reason, she thought that Stelzer's involvement with the Tories was worthy of note. She sought further comment from Conservative sources, and was rewarded by an off-the-record quote from an adviser to the shadow chancellor Francis Maude - who had assembled the panel. In a comment which was attributed to an 'aide' in the next day's edition, the Maude team member said: 'We're not claiming that Murdoch is back with us or anything of the kind. But it is encouraging that someone so close to Murdoch is happy to sit on our council.' As soon as he read the story in Washington, Stelzer was furious. Despite his close association with the News Corp chief, he hates to be portrayed as a Murdoch frontman, and he dashed off an acidic resignation letter to Maude. 'I do hope that the remaining members [of the committee] will help you to improve the forecasting skills that led you to predict a recession immediately before the nation's rate of economic growth soared and unemployment began to fall,' he concluded acidly. Once again, the Tories were rewarded with a crop of negative headlines. With luckless timing that would have been dismissed as unbelievable had it appeared in a work of political fiction, the Stelzer story broke just as news emerged of further criticism of Hague - this time by his predecessor, John Major. Stelzer himself could not avoid a smile to himself. Sitting at home in his Washington apartment, he remarked that the Tories seem to be getting desperate in their search for a good story. Reflecting on the tale over the weekend, he suggests that the Conservative party must think long and hard about what it stands for if it is to regain the confidence of the traditionally 'Tory' press. Although Stelzer stresses once again that he can't speak for Murdoch, the News International stable is clearly in this category. 'I assume media people are intelligent, and there's no reason to believe they are of less than average intelligence, it seems to me the way any politician gets support of media people is through attractive, coherent policies,' he says. As far as Stelzer is concerned, one area where Tory policy is clearly neither attractive nor coherent is European monetary union - a subject close to his heart (he is currently in the process of preparing a Hudson Institute book on European integration). Labour's position of entering economic union when certain criteria are met, Stelzer says, is at least principled - even though he doesn't believe in it. Hague's position is not to enter EMU within a decade. 'It's very hard to ride into battle with the banner 'I want to wait three years longer than Blair wants to wait',' Stelzer says. In some of Stelzer's frequent conversations with Blair, the prime minister has revealed that he can at least understand those who sustain an implacable opposition to the single currency. Michael Portillo, Stelzer suggests, did at least have a position: 'No, never.' It would be one that Hague would do well at least to consider: 'The more you are against it the closer you are to a principle,' Stelzer says. While Hague flounders, Blair's stance is supported by a coherent principle while delivering 'wiggle room' - that all-important room for manoeuvre that all politicians crave."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "media/2000/jan/03/pressandpublishing.mondaymediasection", "type": "article", "sectionId": "media", "sectionName": "Media", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T15:47:56Z", "webTitle": "Recovering a title", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2000/jan/03/pressandpublishing.mondaymediasection", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/media/2000/jan/03/pressandpublishing.mondaymediasection", "fields": {"bodyText": "At the end of the film When We Were Kings, Norman Mailer recalls that his last meeting with Muhammad Ali was at an Esquire party in New York. As we left the cinema my friend Al recalled the line and said: 'What would you say these days? The last time I saw Jamie Theakston, he was at an Esquire party... ' And that is why the job of Esquire editor must be fraught with gloom. Every time you step into your office you are made aware of the huge weight of publishing history resting on your shoulders. The ghost of 1960s US Esquire must sit in the corner, sniffing haughtily as you bung yet another Caprice shoot on the cover and in your heart you must know it will shake its head at almost everything you do. Because, quite simply, 1960s US Esquire was the greatest magazine in the world. Now, Peter Howarth the present editor, says he wants to rediscover that magic. He has a lot to live up to. Which other magazine could claim to have created a new form of journalism and discovered Tom Wolfe and Norman Mailer? Which other magazine could boast writers such as Truman Capote, Vladimir Nabokov, Allen Ginsberg and Edward Albee, and yet be confident enough to attack Capote on its own front page? Esquire was the first mainstream US magazine to take an anti-Vietnam war stance. It campaigned for Muhammad Ali's right to fight. It supported actors such as Jack Nicholson and Dustin Hoffman. It was vilified by Nixon and praised by Warhol and managed to disregard them both. In large part, its place in history was guaranteed by its covers. In 1962, editor Harold Hayes abandoned the idea of using the in-house art department to create his cover and turned to a Madison Avenue advertising executive called George Lois. Lois wanted to create powerful images that sold the magazine without reference to the tedious list of features - 'burn off your belly!', '1,000 ways to be wicked!', 'this year's Bond girl - as you've never seen her before!' - that dominate men's magazine covers these days. It was Lois who persuaded Ali to pose like St Sebastian and who dared to put out an all-black cover with the phrase 'Oh my God - we hit a little girl' on the issue that carried the true story of M Company in Vietnam. It was also Lois who was mainly responsible for the way Esquire's UK editor Peter Howarth felt three months ago when looking at yet another bikini blonde on his cover. 'I was ashamed,' he says. 'My wife looked at the cover I'd brought home and I felt embarrassed. Around the same time, a friend of mine who runs a bar round the corner told me that he can't leave copies of Esquire out when his friends come round because of the cover. In that issue we had a feature from the only journalist to train with the All Blacks and I was sitting at Twickenham with our deputy managing director and wondered how many people here would have known we had that kind of feature. I figured probably none of them.' Howarth was so ashamed that he did something about it. He decided to redesign his magazine, abandoning his 'girl in pants' cover policy completely and replacing it with a head and shoulders shot of the month's cover star. He decided to put his cover lines on a removable strip which can be thrown away once the magazine has been bought, leaving a pure image of the woman or - much more significantly - the man that Esquire has chosen this month. Because Howarth has also decided to abandon the recently accepted market wisdom that it's only chicks on the cover who sell, and that's why this month's Esquire cover star - on sale next week - is Johnny Depp. 'We have this heritage that we publish good writing and great art and that had been lost,' he explains. 'I mean, it's all very well publishing John Updike in the 60s, but we've got some great writers now. We publish people like Martin Amis but we also use the Alex Ferguson principle of playing Eric Cantona alongside Ryan Giggs. That's why we also use new names such as Giles Foden and Matt Seaton, or James Parker or a TV documentary maker called Eamonn O'Neil who does all our investigative stuff. 'People like that are exciting. They are the new Tom Wolfes. British Esquire should be about finding the new New Journalism. It's just that our covers didn't suggest that you were holding that sort of magazine in your hands. If we were the only men's magazine in the market, like Arena was in 1985, you could put whatever you wanted on the cover. But we're not. The ones that sell the most are the ones with the most childish content and the most girls with the least clothes. Our covers suggested we were like them and put off the sort of reader we wanted to attract.' And yet, surely something that is accepted market wisdom is usually accepted for a reason. Loaded recently put Dennis Hopper on the cover and saw its circulation instantly dip by about 50,000. The IPC board panicked and a missive shot down to Loaded's offices asking them to redress the situation sharpish. Isn't Howarth's plucky stance merely the doomed effort of a worthy editor to buck the inevitable? Won't he be on the phone to Caprice's agent by April? 'The board has given me a year,' he says. 'Well, they've given me forever, but I have said to them that you can't judge this in any less time than a year and they backed me, which was very brave of them. The intention is not to lose circulation, and I think that's achievable. 'I should say that this doesn't mean we're abandoning having women in the magazine. This is not a moral crusade. Even Harold Hayes had shoots with Raquel Welch and Angie Dickinson alongside pieces by Wolfe and Mailer. If we were to go down [in circulation], however, then it becomes interesting. Our advertisers are the kind of people who buy predominately on environment. Prada doesn't buy numbers or it would be advertising in FHM. But it isn't. 'The question is, when do the numbers stop making sense? Given the momentum of the title over the last eight months, I'm convinced our readers will stay with us and we can keep selling over 100,000.' He's already dipped his toe into the water with the international edition of the magazine's last issue. In the UK the cover star was model Kate Groombridge, who sat naked against a white background. Overseas the cover star was Damon Albarn, that issue's big interview. Already, the overseas change has produced results. Both Prada and Hugo Boss, Howarth says, have welcomed the move and hope Esquire will move even further towards its 60s character. The big question, of course, is how the UK reader will react. Do any liberal British men reading this feel prompted to go out and buy Esquire?

But the Los Angeles Times has just printed a 14-page, 32,000-word indictment of its own operating practices. Written by a Pulitzer prize-winning staffer, David Shaw, the front page report not only attacked a profit sharing deal between the paper's Sunday magazine and a new, multi-million dollar sports centre - itself the subject of a bumper edition published last October - as 'a tangled tale of ignorance and arrogance', but also cast a harsh light on the paper's editor Michael Parks, its publisher Kathryn Downing, and chief executive Mark Willes. It was not the kind of confession you would expect from a British newspaper but then here there has yet to be such a high-velocity, head-on collision between the business of newspapers and the objective, independent principles of journalism. The report, which was not seen by the editor or publisher prior to publication, was designed to re-establish the paper's 'bond of trust' with its readership - a bond its reporters felt had been badly sullied. As a result of the deal with the Staples Centre, and the ensuing controversy, Shaw wrote: 'The Times' credibility and integrity - ultimately the only commodities a newspaper has to offer - have been severely compromised at a time when public confidence in the press is already in deep decline.' On October 10, the LA Times published an unusually large, 164-page magazine supplement entirely devoted to the Staples sports arena in downtown Los Angeles without revealing to its readership, or its own reporters, that the $2m the issue raised in advertising revenue would be split between the paper and its subject. Nor was it revealed that the ads were sold with the assistance of the Staples ad staff or that the Times is a corporate sponsor of the arena and had committed to pay $1.6m in cash and free advertising for five years in exchange for 'joint revenue opportunities' - such as a special magazine issue - and a permanent corporate box. What may have seemed like a bright, profit-boosting idea to the paper's new publisher, Kathryn Downing, soon dimmed when word of the scheme leaked out to the city's alternative weekly, the New Times. Amid intense internal protest, the publisher and editors maintained the arrangement had not influenced their coverage but the issue soon came to be seen as the ugly tip of an ethical iceberg that threatened to undermine the paper's integrity and reputation. The paper's 300 reporters signed a petition demanding that Downing - who had no experience in newspapers and had only been in the job six months - apologise and undertake a thorough review that would unearth any other dubious financial relationships. Unfortunately for Downing, it did. The Staples issue 'creates an impression that maybe the editorial independence of the newsroom is up for grabs and maybe that independence has to be proven now,' says Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism in Washington DC. 'Even if it's not true, readers might wonder: 'Did they kill critical stories?' or 'Maybe they didn't assign tough ones'.' The furore grew with a contribution from former LA Times publisher, Otis Chandler, scion of the family that has had a controlling stake in the newspaper since 1882. Chandler called the management's behaviour 'unbelievably stupid and unprofessional' and said the episode was the 'most serious single threat to the future survival and growth of the paper'. Downing retorted that Chandler was 'angry and bitter'. Ultimately, Downing did apologise but was hardly able to instill much confidence when she revealed that the profit-sharing arrangement and her failure to reveal it came from her 'fundamental misunderstanding' of a publisher's role and ignorance of newspaper ethics. Nor did the paper's editor look much better - he said he knew of the deal after the magazine was completed but before it was distributed and yet failed to stop delivery or notify readers. 'Clearly, I underestimated the impact of the Staples arrangement on our credibility, on the journalistic ethos that we foster, on our standing in the community and in the profession,' Parks told Shaw. 'And for all those things I have profound regret.' Although the investigation did not find a smoking gun, it did identify an incremental evolution of mistakes that led to the fiasco. The first inkling of the future disaster came in 1995 when the paper's parent, Times Mirror, hired Mark Willes - a former General Mills executive who had earned the title Cap'n Crunch for his vigorous cost-cutting methods at the food giant - to re-invent the business of running a newspaper. Under his predecessor, Chandler (a champion surfer, a former shot-putter who came within inches of the world record, a racing-car driver and big-game hunter), the paper had gained in stature but remained junior to the big three, the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal, in terms of reach and importance. During Chandler's 30-year tenure, he behaved like a proprietor of the old school. He lavished money on the paper - it stationed 14 correspondents and photographers in the Soviet Union during the collapse of communism - and built up a considerable circulation, peaking at 1.2m in 1990. But in the Californian recession of the early nineties, the LA Times began haemorrhaging money and its board members and stockholders (largely made up of Chandlers) became increasingly unhappy with the cost of fulfilling Otis's dream to knock the New York Times 'off its perch'. Enter Willes as publisher and chief executive, a man with the stated intention to 'blow up' - with a 'bazooka' if necessary - the wall that separates the newsroom from the business side of the paper. Instrumental to his plan to boost circulation and profits and drive up the stock price, was the aim that the business concerns of the paper would now be a regular part of newsroom decisions, editors would be required to work closely with advertising staff identifying stories that would appeal to advertisers, and different sections of the paper would operate as separate business units. Despite widespread warnings at the time that applying his consumer product savvy to a newspaper could upset the fine balance between editorial and advertising, Willes advanced his plan. The book review section, for instance, would now give special consideration to books published by houses with large advertising budgets. Willes and his team had many other ideas, many of which are only now surfacing: the paper received a sales commission for books sold by Barnes &amp; Noble if the reader of a Times online book review clicked over to the retailer. Man agement had proposed publication of a special section on a local car racetrack for which the track would receive a commission for ads it sold in the paper. Shaw's report also noted that the paper devoted heavy coverage to conferences and other events it sponsored and that the news staff had helped organise. Although none of these examples is spectacularly heinous, and similar changes have been instituted at other newspapers as they try to find new revenue and staunch declining circulations, the irony of the Times affair is that it seems to have been caused by too little communication between business and editorial, not too much. Nor have Willes' reforms necessarily worked. Though Times Mirror's stock price has tripled since 1995 after he cut costs and sold assets, circulation of the LA Times remains flat at 1m and he has yet to find a radical cure for what ails the business. 'Newspapers that don't take appropriate risks to meet the challenge of a rapidly changing media environment are doomed to die,' he says. In the end, the profit-sharing agreement obliged the Times to pay Staples Center about $300,000; a relatively small amount of money for a paper that enjoys almost $1bn a year in advertising revenue. But the damage to its reputation, particularly in a country where the press sees itself as having explicit constitutional significance and full disclosure, has been marked. 'The wall [between the newsroom and business] used to represent a clear protection of editorial integrity and independence from the influence of advertisers,' Downing said in a statement, before acknowledging that the cultural change at the paper did not include putting into place 'protocols to replace what we took away'. In clarification of its journalistic principles, and the rules of engagement between the editorial and business sides, the paper published a manifesto of intent, including one commitment reading: 'advertising may not be co-ordinated with or sold against specific stories or graphics in a way that raises questions of credibility of integrity'. Another said that if 'the editorial mission and the commercial interests of the Times conflict, editorial integrity will always come first'.

In military terms that might suggest he is easily satisfied, for the quick resolution of the war expected last month shows little sign of arriving; the rebels are far from quelled, Grozny is, as we write, yet to be taken and more bloody conflict, in line with this weekend's escalation, is likely before Russia gets its way. But undoubtedly in terms of Mr Putin's own advancement, the armed forces have done a good job indeed. His breathtaking ascent from obscurity to the role of acting president - and more than that, president presumptive, as from the end of March - may not be exclusively due to the war in Chechnya, but that has clearly been its most powerful ingredient. Indeed, promoting Mr Putin, may be what this second Chechen war is all about. That is not just because getting tough with the Chechens has played so well with Russian public opinion: it is also because Mr Putin looks clear-headed, decisive, indeed ruthless, when the leadership of the country in the closing years of President Yeltsin has looked utterly the reverse. He is riding so high in the polls because he promises order to a disordered country. He promises the smack of firm government, delivered if need be with a mailed fist. Once that was Boris Yeltsin's appeal, when with the kind of courage which borders on foolhardiness, he climbed on the tank in 1991 to rout the projected putsch against Gorbachev; and again as he successfully engineered the end of Communist rule. For their own political reasons - largely the fear of something still worse - western leaders have been doing their best in the late 90s to pretend that Yeltsin was still the deci sive leader of earlier days, when in fact he had been reduced, by ill-health compounded by drink, to a capricious, confused and sometimes literally tottering figure. So the economy foundered and the standards of daily life grew worse rather than better, and people increasingly yearned for the stability of communist times: a development to which the west has contributed by insisting on economic solutions which put ideology first and left the easing of change, which is part of all practical politics, limping woefully behind. Crime and corruption flourished. If this was the `genius' which some on the right in Britain continue to see in Yeltsin, it was genius of a fitful and sozzled kind. And yet the end game, whoever devised it, has indeed had a touch of genius about it. The singling out of Vladimir Putin. The confection of a political party which has no greater remit than to support what he says and does. Elections for the duma which though democratic in name were profoundly undemocratic in practice, with a television coverage that was more party political broadcast on behalf of Unity than open democratic debate. And now the near-perfect scenario for elections in March rather than June, with no time for his country's uncharacteristic new year optimism to shrivel. And for Boris Yeltsin himself, a permanent exoneration for whatever he may have done; immunity from prosecution and an absolute guarantee of no questions asked, which given the suspicions hanging over him, he urgently needed; a fat pension and other perks to ensure a life of safety and comfort for the rest of his days. Most western tributes to him as he departs have so far been sensibly muted. Whatever Mr Putin may now produce, it was more than time for Russia to come under new management."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/03/russia.iantraynor", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T16:38:51Z", "webTitle": "Yeltsin's resignation caught opposition flat-footed", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/03/russia.iantraynor", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/03/russia.iantraynor", "fields": {"bodyText": "Russia's centre-left opposition has been plunged into disarray by Boris Yeltsin's snap resignation designed to boost the presidential prospects of his protege, Vladimir Putin. Reeling from the New Year's Eve coup, the opposition appears at a loss about how to mount a credible challenge to the acting president and prime minister. The presidential election is expected on March 26 - three months earlier than scheduled. And the campaign effectively kicked off on New Year's Day, with Mr Putin shown live on state television during a morale-boosting visit to Russian troops in Chechnya. 'Russia thanks you,' he told Russian officers and soldiers. Already the darling of the military because of his hard line on Chechnya, Mr Putin burnished his army credentials further by telling the top brass and the country that the military and not the politicians would decide on the pace and conduct of the war. However, Mr Putin faces three declared candidates in the race for the Kremlin: Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime minister and foreign minister, Grigory Yavlinsky, the liberals' leader, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the extreme nationalist. It is also assumed that Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist party's leader who lost to Mr Yeltsin in 1996, will also stand. The first three all declared their candidatures just before the elections to the duma two weeks ago in an attempt to enhance their vote. But only the Communist vote stood up, although they are 35 seats worse off in the new parlia ment, which is dominated by centrists and promises far greater support for Mr Putin than Mr Yeltsin ever enjoyed. Can Mr Putin be stopped? Mr Yavlinsky's candidacy can be effectively discounted, and Mr Putin's main opposition will come from the centre-left, the Communists and the Fatherland-All Russia movement (OVR) of Mr Primakov and the Moscow mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. The former Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, responded to the Yeltsin resignation by urging the centre-left to unite behind a single candidate, Mr Primakov, to maximise the vote against Mr Putin. The Communists are the best organised and most disciplined party machine in Russia and could probably guarantee Mr Primakov a quarter of the electorate. But that would entail Mr Zyuganov eating humble pie and standing aside. But despite Mr Primakov's declared candidacy two weeks ago, it is no longer clear if he will run. Mr Luzhkov declined to endorse Mr Primakov last Friday, saying there would need to be 'consultations'. Moreover, the number three in the OVR, Vladimir Yakovlev, the mayor of Russia's second city, St Petersburg, faces re-election in May and is already flirting with the Putin camp. Gennady Seleznev, the Communist speaker of the outgoing duma says frankly that Mr Putin looks unbeatable. The interim president has returned the compliment by voicing support for the Communist in his bid to be governor of the greater Moscow region. In short, while the opposition fractures in the face of the Putin phenomenon, the acting president and prime minister is busy building a broader support base - ambitious politicians of all stripes are suddenly eager to bask in his glory. State television propaganda has been hugely instrumental in building up Mr Putin and in securing the strong showing of his allies in the duma election. The next three months will see a continuation of that campaign. And if Mr Primakov, 70, confirms his candidacy, he will be painted as an elderly, unreconstructed communist by state television. At the moment, the question is not whether Mr Putin can be beaten, but whether the opposition can force him into a second round by denying him an outright victory on March 26."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/03/monarchy.freedomofinformation", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T16:42:32Z", "webTitle": "Diana's landmine crusade put Tories in a panic", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/03/monarchy.freedomofinformation", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/03/monarchy.freedomofinformation", "fields": {"bodyText": "A graphic account of how John Major's government was gripped by panic over Princess Diana's uncompromising stance on a worldwide ban on landmines is revealed in previously secret diplomatic cables. They were sent by American ambassadors to the US secretary of state, Madeline Albright, during the princess's visit to Angola. They reveal that the Americans believed Diana had 'bested' John Major and the foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, after a junior defence minister, Earl Howe, had accused her of being a 'loose cannon'. They also contain a revealing insight into how she refused to 'wine and dine' the social elite and snubbed the daughter of an African king in favour of meeting the Angolan people. Such attitudes caused considerable embarrassment for the British ambassador in Angola, Roger Hart, who had to sneak in VIP guests to eat char sui and bean sprouts with the princess. The trip, in January 1997, caused huge controversy in the press when she appeared to endorse Labour's policy of a worldwide ban on landmines. The US cables show that the Americans - who later cooled on the idea of a ban - could scarcely conceal their delight at her strong stance and even told the British ambassador in Angola what a great success her visit had been. Blow-by-blow accounts of the princess's controversial visit were sent to Ms Albright from Admiral William Crowe, then US ambassador to Britain, and Donald Steinberg, then US ambassador to Angola. The cables released to the Guardian under the US freedom of information act would be banned from publication in Britain until 2072 because of their mention of the royal family. Admiral Crowe's cable - written in the same colourful language as his outspoken comments about the royals and William Hague after Diana's death - is headed 'Princess Di trips political landmine'. 'Controversy and/or room for misunderstanding was inherent in the princess's trip' because the British Red Cross wanted an immediate worldwide ban on anti-personnel mines, while the government's position was that Britain would not support a ban until all countries had signed a deal. Once the princess had made her statement supporting a worldwide ban, she was attacked by Earl Howe for being 'ill-informed on the issue of anti-personnel mines' and a 'loose cannon' ' that Her Majesty's government did not need'. Admiral Crowe says: 'Government officials immediately scrambled to repair the public relations damage and issued statements affirming the government's commitment to 'working toward a worldwide ban on landmines'.' A Downing Street spokesman was quoted as claiming there had been a 'misunderstanding' and that the princess's remarks were not 'inconsistent with government policy'. He adds: 'Labour party officials used the flap to highlight differences between Labour and the Conservative government on the landmine issue.' Mr Steinberg tells Ms Albright from Luanda that by the time the three-day trip had finished the princess had 'bested a political furore in London', adding that Mr Major and Mr Rifkind had 'stepped in to cool things off'. He also reports approvingly of how she shunned celebrity status. 'She wanted a serious visit, not to be seen wining and dining with the social elite. The daughter of the king of the Lundas wanted to meet with her British counterpart, but failed. The princess accepted a dinner invitation hosted by first lady Ana Paula Dos Santos (the Angolan president's wife) on condition that it be small (26 guests ate from a catered Chinese food buffet) short (it ended at 8.10pm) and there be no press or speeches. Hart (the British ambassador) managed to get the local directors of Shell, BP and De Beers invited. 'Hart himself held only a dinner for her and Red Cross officials.' The reports also discloses that Mr Major's government had the added problem that Diana had been fully briefed of the British position by the foreign office and the visit had been personally approved by the Queen. 'For her part, the princess was looking for a new public cause to promote that would not conflict with the interests of other members of the royal family.' The US ambassador's report adds that originally the Red Cross wanted to send her to Vietnam or Cambodia but this was ruled out by the foreign office as too dangerous. Mr Steinberg concludes: 'She was excited about the results and talking about more visits to Vietnam, Cambodia, Kuwait and return engagement in Angola. No one can come to Angola and see the human devastation caused by landmines and not be moved. We have told the British ambassador how seriously the United States' government takes this problem and how much we appreciate Diana's support.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "society/2000/jan/03/futureofthenhs.health", "type": "article", "sectionId": "society", "sectionName": "Society", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T16:48:50Z", "webTitle": "Sara Denver, nurse turned solicitor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2000/jan/03/futureofthenhs.health", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2000/jan/03/futureofthenhs.health", "fields": {"bodyText": "At the age of 18, Sara Denver set her heart on becoming a nurse and embarked on almost four years of training - first a degree, then a course to specialise in cardiothoracic intensive care.

After spending such a long time training, it never occurred to her that she would want to change, particularly to a career which would involve an even longer period of study. But a chance conversation with a disaffected doctor who had decided to jettison medicine in favour of law had a profound effect on her. She began to find out as much as she could about training and what a job as a solicitor would entail. 'I wanted to find out as much as I could, as once you've left a career it's quite hard to go back to it.' Research completed, she decided that law would suit her perfectly. And she hoped that when she qualified she would be able to use some of her skills gained in the NHS to specialise in medical negligence cases. Another protracted training stint followed - this time for five years - with a one-year law conversion course then two years of legal practice and finally a two-year training contract with a firm of solicitors. 'I qualified in September and it feels great. I loved the challenge of studying for something new; law was something I really wanted to do for myself but at the same time I think I've chosen something useful.' While she doesn't know of many lawyers who have changed career direction, Denver, 32, can think of many colleagues from medicine who are now doing different jobs. She says an increasing number of medical negligence cases are being taken out, which means an abundant supply of work is likely. 'I don't know whether the incidences of negligence are increasing or whether people are becoming more aware of legal action as an option.' She is certain there won't be any more lightning career changes. 'This is it now. I'm so much happier in this career; I feel I can really make a difference to people.

As Mr Kohl braced himself for the start today of a criminal investigation into his activities as party leader, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, who succeeded him as party chairman last year, was last night under growing pressure from political friends and foes alike to explain a mysterious - and apparently illicit - movement of funds. The transfer was spotted in figures the Christian Democrats were forced to make public because of the Kohl affair. The accounts, released last Friday, revealed that in January 1997 more than 1m marks (\u00a3350,000) was sent by the parliamentary party to party headquarters in apparent contravention of Germany's law on political financing. Mr Sch\u00e4uble was leader of the parliamentary party at the time. A senior Christian Democrat, Hans Georg Wagner, told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper: \"Sch\u00e4uble must have known about it. He has a duty to tell us exactly where the money came from and exactly what it was used for.\" There is no evidence that the money came from tainted sources and Christian Democrats yesterday insisted that it was handed over in compliance with the law. The legal adviser to the Christian Democrat Union (CDU), Andreas Schmidt, said the cash had been built up out of the monthly 50 mark fees that members of parliament paid to the parliamentary party. He added that the account in which the money was held had to be closed because of a change in the law and that the subsequent transfer was perfectly legal. However, as the Christian Democrats' opponents pointed out, the amount involved was surprisingly large. The parliamentary leader of the Greens, Rezzo Schlauch, expressed disbelief that so much could have been raised with membership subscription. \"It smells like something illegal,\" he said. Prosecutors in Bonn are today due to begin their investigation of Mr Kohl. Germany's longest-serving chancellor of the 20th century has admitted he ran secret accounts for party donations which, in apparent violation of the law, were never disclosed. Mr Kohl risks being charged with an offence that carries penalties of up to five years in jail. Another Greens MP, Volker Beck, said: \"If it turns out that, in violation of campaign finance laws, money from the CDU parliamentary group went to the CDU headquarters, then we will have to open up a Sch\u00e4uble file as well.\" An all-party parliamentary commission of inquiry will begin in February to look at claims that some donations to the Christian Democrats during the Kohl era were bribes or rewards. Questions have been raised about payments by property developers and an arms dealer, all of whom benefited from government decisions. Mr Sch\u00e4uble, who was a loyal Kohl lieutenant, is regarded as a man of personal integrity and has emphasised that his predecessor, who was chairman for 25 years, ran the party in a distinctly paternalistic manner. The only doubts expressed about Mr Sch\u00e4uble before now have been whether he had, as he claimed, been unaware of the secret accounts until reading of them in the newspapers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "uk/2000/jan/03/ruralaffairs.world", "type": "article", "sectionId": "uk-news", "sectionName": "UK news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T18:29:40Z", "webTitle": "Hunters threaten Jospin with new battle of the Somme", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/03/ruralaffairs.world", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/uk/2000/jan/03/ruralaffairs.world", "fields": {"bodyText": "They have been shooting ducks on the salt marshes of the bay of the Somme more or less since guns were invented, and they did not stop even when the Nazis threatened to execute anyone found with a gun. `We didn't surrender our rifles to the Germans, so anyone who thinks a couple of anti-hunting directives from the European Union and an environment-friendly Socialist government are going to stop us has got it wrong,' said Jean Pilniak of the regional hunters' federation. A countryside crisis over bloodsports has already spawned a new political movement by France's 1.5m hunters - Chasse, Peche, Nature et Tradition, or CPNT - which collected an astonishing 7% of the national vote in the European elections last June. That was slightly more than the Communists, who are a part of the governing coalition. In Mr Pilniak's department of the Somme, CPNT emerged as the biggest party, winning 27% of the vote against the ruling Socialist party's 16%. Six of its MEPs sit in the European parliament, where they have formed a highly vocal parliamentary group with half a dozen like-minded Danes and Dutchmen and three members of the Eurosceptic UK Independence Party. `If [prime minister Lionel] Jospin riles us, our vote is now big enough to lose him 64 seats at the next election,' said Yves Butel, one of its MEPs. For 20 years, successive French governments have successfully staved off EU directives that would significantly curb hunting. But two things are likely to force the prime minister's hand. A new report from a Socialist MP, Fran\u00e7ois Patriat, suggests - besides improved safety regulations for a notoriously dangerous sport that kills 40 people a year - that the government really has no option but to shorten the hunting season. And the council of state, which weighs the legality of all government decisions, has declared finally and conclusively that France is breaking EU rules. The start of the July 14-February 28 season, it said in a potentially explosive verdict, will have to be delayed by six weeks, and the end brought forward by a month. Caught between the votes of the hunters and an anti-hunting lobby that includes his coalition partners, the Greens, Mr Jospin will have to tread very carefully indeed in the new hunting legislation he has promised to introduce before next summer. A more immediate danger is that ecologists and anti-bloodsports campaigners have promised to use the council of state ruling to launch legal proceedings against any local authority that allows hunters to continue shooting after January 31."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "sport/2000/jan/03/matchreportscricket.cricket", "type": "article", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T19:44:23Z", "webTitle": "Flintoff injury piles on woe for England", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2000/jan/03/matchreportscricket.cricket", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2000/jan/03/matchreportscricket.cricket", "fields": {"bodyText": "Andrew Flintoff, the all-rounder on whom England have pinned their future hopes, broke a bone in his left foot while bowling at Newlands yesterday. Flintoff appeared in distress after completing his fourth over of the day and sat on the pitch with his boot removed before hobbling from the field. An x-ray revealed a crack in the metatarsal bone adjacent to his big toe. He will see a specialist this morning. Although early for a confident prognosis, it seems unlikely he will be able to bowl for some time and could miss not just the end of the Test series, but the one-day matches which follow. According to the England physiotherapist Dean Conway, the injury was not stress-related, but was caused by a single impact. It is not a complete fracture (which would mean six-to-eight weeks on the sidelines) but roughly a third the width of the bone. \"Had he attempted to bowl even one or two more deliveries, it could have been made considerably worse,\" said Conway. \"He certainly will be unable to bowl again in this match and probably the next as well. He is in pain and will have to bat with a runner in the second innings. \"It is difficult to say whether he would be fit for the one-day squad but he must be considered doubtful as far as bowling is concerned.\" Although only 22, Flintoff has an unenviable fitness record. A back problem has never been fully resolved and, ironically, he has been nursed along gently as a bowler on this tour. Only recently has he been allowed to contribute a full day's work with the ball. He is a huge lad - some 17st - who generates pace with a vigorous body and arm action, slamming his front foot down hard in delivery. Clearly, even for someone of his strength, the force is too much. The news of Flintoff's injury was the cherry on the cake, for things did not go England's way yesterday. Bowled out in the morning for 258, they needed wickets early on, took but one, and struggled in the sun thereafter as Gary Kirsten and Jacques Kallis began the process of batting England out of the game and the series. There was no luck going for England but a team that is down on its uppers, as this side were on the second day, tends not to have any. So twice, brilliant pieces of fielding at point by Michael Vaughan counted for nothing when on each occasion his shy at the stumps missed, letting off first Herschelle Gibbs and then Kirsten on 22. On a good day at least one would have found its target. In between Kallis, on 11, was dropped by Alec Stewart behind the wicket off Chris Silverwood, the ball jolting from the keeper's right glove as his arm hit the ground following a spectacular dive. Contrast with Vaughan's ill fortune in playing a firm and legitimate shot off his hips straight into the midriff of short leg - who clung on only through reflex - and an lbw decision that went against Phil Tufnell later on when Kirsten had 67, and the picture becomes as clear as was Table Mountain yesterday. England - sadly, for they have promised much - look like they are waving goodbye to the series. By the close, Kirsten and Kallis had taken their unbroken second-wicket partnership to 157, taking advantage of bowling which, not surprisingly after Durban, looked jaded - particularly that of Andy Caddick - and indisciplined. Hittable balls were two-a-penny at times and, in both reaching 80, Kirsten and Kallis struck eight fours apiece with Kallis hooking a six off Silverwood for good measure. At 200 for one, South Africa need just 59 more to pass England, whose last hope of winning rests with the new ball, due in 13 overs, and more incisive bowling. A crass piece of cricket so often precipitates England's worst collapses and the folly of Stewart's suicidal dismissal as Sunday's play drew to a close was evidenced by the way England folded yesterday. Had they begun the day with three wickets down rather than five, there might have been a different complexion on things. Instead England were never in command. Vaughan, the key player left, became Allan Donald's fifth wicket (when he snared Stewart for his fourth, he overtook Sydney Barnes as the leading wicket taker, with 84, in Tests between the two countries). Adams swashed at the day's first ball and missed but repeated the stroke an hour later and was caught at the wicket. Flintoff, with the tail, slogged and three balls later Gough edged giving Lance Klusener, bowling his only over of the day, his first wickets in 106 overs of trying. Tufnell, as is his wont, surrendered. \u0095 Pakistan have appealed against the International Cricket Council's decision to ban the pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar for an illegal action.

Darren Gough would never admit to such a thing. Gough is always full of bluster, has one eye on the speedometer reading at third man and tries his rocks off for his side. Yet in this series a below-par Donald has taken twice as many wickets as a below-par Gough, and the difference is beginning to show. Donald has just taken his 20th five-wicket haul in Tests on this most unresponsive of Newlands pitches. He was helped by the benevolence of various England batsmen and the quick reactions of Gary Kirsten who took four catches of varying degrees of difficulty. Donald had assistance at the Wanderers too: troubled by injury and a technical glitch, he was gifted the most bowler-friendly surface imaginable on which to ply his trade. He took 11 wickets as South Africa steamrollered England in the opening Test. Gough, in contrast, has just 10 wickets in the series. He came into the tour without having bowled in serious cricket since early summer and looked slightly overweight and understandably rusty. A fast bowler need overs under his belt for rhythm and fitness and Gough has taken too long for England's liking to get into his stride on this tour. His frustration appears to be mounting. Lack of wickets preys on a bowler's mind and Gough knows how much England have relied on him to spearhead their attack. Andy Caddick has now taken over his mantle as the leading strike bowler, but clearly England would be a much more potent attacking force with Gough at his best. Gough does not relish relinquishing his leading role and there are signs of petulance emerging. Yesterday he continued his run-in with the former England fast bowler, Bob Willis, now a Sky Sports commentator. This began in the previous match in Durban when Gough was heard to say over the stump microphone \"This is a waste of time\" as England were toiling on the last day to dislodge South Africa for a second time. Willis responded by saying in his commentary \"If you think it's a waste of time, Darren, then you shouldn't be out there\". Gough took exception to the remark and yesterday just before tea when he was heard to say over the stump mike \"How would you bowl on this, Willis?\" it was obvious his frustration was taking over. The simple answer is that Willis would have bowled with as much heart and effort as Gough has done through his career, but the Yorkshireman has rather missed the point. Gough does not need to trouble himself with anything but his own bowling. He must let the ball do the talking. Gough would do well to study Donald's approach. Both bowlers have known frustration and unrewarded hard work but Donald seems to have the more equable temperament. Gough used to be able to laugh it all off, come success or stress, but no more. Ask a sports psychologist what makes the difference between success and failure in any player, at any level, and the answer will essentially take up one word: attitude. Until this series Gough's attitude has always appeared exemplary on the field but now his frustration is affecting this, his most precious asset. The best bowlers never blame the pitch, the wind, the footholds, the ball, the batsman or the fielders. They just get on with the job. Donald will never let himself be dragged down by such distractions. Gough has been England's bowling beacon since coming into the side, his brilliant attitude the key to his performances. Now is no time to change all that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/match.sport", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T20:19:34Z", "webTitle": "Wear wolves have turned into lambs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport", "fields": {"bodyText": "Sunderland were relegated from the Premiership after losing at Wimbledon in May 1997. Yesterday's defeat against the same club may signal a different sort of demise. Peter Reid's Premiership upstarts have taken only one point from the past nine and suddenly the sound of bubbles bursting has nothing to do with new year champagne. Though they had six first-team players out injured, Wimbledon's makeshift side made relatively easy work of taking three points to ease themselves away from the relegation mire. Had they won, Sunderland could have gone third. But they began the game as if they were still preening themselves about the past year rather than getting to grips with the next. And they paid the price. Unusually for a team whose success has been built on fight and spirit, Sunderland seemed laid-back for much of the first half and struggled to get to grips with a game played in driving rain on a deteriorating pitch. It would be falling into a stereotyping trap to say this is Wimbledon's natural habitat, but certainly they adjusted to the conditions far better and could have been three up after 15 minutes. First, Andy Marriott, replacing the flu-ridden Thomas Sorensen in goal, saved well from Carl Cort. The England Under-21 striker then fired wide from an inviting position and soon after Jason Euell shot at the goalkeeper when he was put in six yards out. So it was hardly a surprise when Wimbledon opened the scoring on the half-hour. After a rare Sunderland counter-attack broke down the visitors were caught short at the back. A twist and turn on the left of the area by the impressive Martin Andresen ended with a little chip to the back of the six-yard box, where Cort, unmarked, headed past Marriott for his 13th goal of the season. Despite Niall Quinn and Kevin Phillips being passed fit, Sunderland struggled to pose any serious threat to Neil Sullivan's goal, mainly for want of a decent final ball. And it did not help when Nicky Summerbee went off injured after a clash with Ben Thatcher in the build-up to the goal. It was only as half-time approached that the visitors began to wake from their slumbers and they should have equalised seconds before the break when Phillips uncharacteristically fired a seven-yard shot straight at the goalkeeper. Whatever Reid said at half-time certainly did the trick as Sunderland emerged a reinvigorated side. Quinn soon headed just over then Kevin Kilbane held off Kenny Cunningham in the area only to see his goalbound shot tipped away acrobatically by Sullivan. Wimbleon also went close through Hermann Hreidarsson and Euell but it was Sunderland who had the bit between their teeth and as the minutes increased so did the visiting side's pressure and desperation. With seconds left Phillips cut in from the left and cracked a 20-yard drive against the angle. Soon afterwards Quinn headed goalward only to see Sullivan pull off a diving save. Sunderland have enjoyed a great start to this season, but not a great start to the year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/match.sport1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T20:23:35Z", "webTitle": "Saints party like it's 1999", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport1", "fields": {"bodyText": "For Southampton it is always but a small step from the party to sobriety. The threat of relegation is never far away, but they were able to give their nerve ends a respite yesterday. It was hard to reconcile the drum beating of the local radio man who insisted \"they don't come any bigger than this\" with recent form displayed by these sides, but this was a win of some magnitude for Dave Jones's team. Thanks to Kevin Davies's third goal in as many games they achieved their first victory here since August and put daylight between themselves and their Yorkshire visitors, who slip into the bottom three. \"We have allowed the other teams to catch up, which was disappointing after the good start we had,\" admitted Jones. \"We could have made life a lot easier for ourselves today but overall I think we deserved it.\" Last season Southampton won seven of their final nine games at the Dell to stay afloat. Though a long road still lies ahead the view looks better for them than it does for Bradford. After his travails at Blackburn and the growing suspicion that he was a Premiership performer only in transfer valuations and not through deeds on the field, Davies can continue to be a crucial figure for them as long as confidence remains on his side. Yesterday the drive and determination the young striker displayed throughout made it entirely appropriate that his header 11 minutes into the second half should prove decisive. He found half a yard as the Bradford defence hesitated at a Stuart Ripley free-kick and it was enough for him to defeat Matt Clark. \"When he came back Kevin did not have a head on his shoulders. It was somewhere under his arm,\" said Jones. \"Whatever went on at Blackburn, hopefully he has learned from the experience. He needed to prove something to himself above all and with his goals he is starting to do just that.\" Soon after scoring Davies found himself back in his own goalmouth with a vital intervention as Lee Mills shaped to shoot. His strength in the air helped keep Saints in the ascendancy and with Ripley and Luis Boa Morte relishing every opportunity to take on their opposite numbers the home team had the means to make this a more convincing win. The woodwork played its part. Jo Tessem rattled the crossbar before half-time and Marian Pahars later placed his shot against the inside of a post. Bradford survived and when Robbie Blake was introduced there was suddenly a new dimension to their raids. Blake raced into the area to give himself just Paul Jones to beat. Not only did the Welshman block that attempt he also did enough to distract Dean Saunders, who could only hook the rebound over. The goalkeeper came under attack from his own supporters, who wanted to see him gather the ball more cleanly. Yet with rain sweeping across the pitch conditions were particularly difficult for goalkeepers. Many tackles were mistimed on the slippery surface but commendably David Elleray kept his cards in his pocket. Even Dave Jones was impressed. \"Credit where it's due, even if David is not my flavour and I've had a few run-ins with him. If I'm going to give marks out of 10 he'll get at least a four.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/match.sport2", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T20:27:32Z", "webTitle": "Hammers hand Robson a youthful lesson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport2", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport2", "fields": {"bodyText": "Nikos Dabizas may have had the honour of registering Newcastle United's first goal of the 21st century, but by the end all the attention was being lavished upon the nearest thing football has to a bunch of millennium babies. West Ham, with 10 senior players injured, fielded three of last season's Youth Cup winning side, with another three staring starry-eyed from the bench. All this talk of a new era of youthful opportunity has clearly had an uplifting effect, for the Hammers scored twice in the last five minutes to steal a point that had seemed beyond them. Nobody could have complained had Newcastle, with 15 minutes remaining, gone three ahead, when Kevin Gallacher, still without a goal for the club, responded in disbelief as Shaka Hislop turned aside his ferocious drive. \"Shaka has been an unbelievable free transfer,\" said West Ham's manager Harry Redknapp and as it was Newcastle from whence he came, the reminder was hard to bear. Newcastle, perhaps crucially, had lost Rob Lee to a thigh injury soon after half-time. His replacement, Jose Antunes, is the sort who cannot make up his mind about his name or allegiance, being known as Fumaca in various other loan deals around the country. Neither could he decide whether to mark Frank Lampard, who with great deliberation stroked a 25-yard shot wide of Steve Harper and in off the left post. Newcastle were equally slack for West Ham's equaliser three minutes from time. Joe Cole, who had coped maturely with an unfamiliar role just behind a lone striker, Trevor Sinclair, was fouled 30 yards from goal. From Sinclair's free kick, Igor Stimac was left unmarked to head his first goal for West Ham. \"The kids did great,\" said Redknapp. \"I was going to bring on a 16-year-old - Jermaine Defoe - as well but he's probably got school in the morning.\" Talk of all these West Ham youngsters is a particular embarrassment for Newcastle. Successive managers showed disregard for youth development in one of the most fertile breeding grounds in the land and Bobby Robson has been left to address such stupidity. His recovery has been based on sound principles and seemed set to continue when Dabizas shot past Hislop, who was still reeling from Alan Shearer's challenge for Alessandro Pistone's hanging cross. All thoughts of a West Ham recovery seemed to evaporate by the mid-point of the second half. First Harper dashed across his line to save brilliantly from Marc Keller after Sinclair had outfoxed Pistone. Then Newcastle scored a second. Solano jinked infield from the right and his low cross was met by Gary Speed's perfectly executed volley. Newcastle, with victory seeming assured, then fell asleep.

Gareth Southgate, a man for whom the 1990s will inexorably be linked with missed penalty kicks, opened the new decade in more fruitful fashion with both Villa goals. This was a deserved away success against the Premiership leaders, on what may prove a pivotal day in the title race. \"All the other results went for us,\" said the Leeds manager David O'Leary, \"but the team that will laugh most is Manchester United in Brazil - and they have been the yardstick all along. When you don't play well at home you still want to pick up a point, and we could have come off the pitch with at least a draw.\" O'Leary had previously suggested that Leeds's to-be-rearranged match against United at Elland Road should be reserved until the last game of the season. The chances of it being a title decider receded yesterday, and the manner in which Leeds failed to cope with an injury and suspension list that denied them Lucas Radebe, Lee Bowyer, David Batty, David Hopkin and Stephen McPhail may offer an uncanny comparison with the plight of Villa 12 months ago. Gregory believes his team's capitulation last season, in which they won just four of their final 17 games having led the league at the turn of the year, was the result of a lack of depth in his squad. \"Even a club like Manchester United would find it pretty hard to lose their entire midfield,\" O'Leary offered in mitigation. \"But you are judged over a season and, as I have said all along, I don't know where we will finish. \"United are the best team in the league and that's a fact. We're trying to do our best but it's a young side, and today it was a really, really young side.\" Such naivete - a characteristic O'Leary is so fond of telling you he also possesses as a manager - was exposed at the two set pieces that brought Southgate his first Villa goals since December 1998. In the 19th minute his goalbound header from a Paul Merson corner struck his team-mate Julian Joachim on the back, only for Southgate to scramble it into the net with a fortunate mishit. Then, just after the hour, Merson's free-kick found Southgate eluding Jonathon Woodgate at the back of the Leeds area to score with a stooping header. \"He's known as 'The Ornament',\" said the tirelessly entertaining Gregory. \"He goes up for every corner, every free-kick and becomes, well, an ornament! He never touches the ball so he was an unlikely match winner, to say the least.\" In between Southgate's efforts, Harry Kewell conjured a superb individual equaliser 11 seconds into the second half. The Australian chested down a loose ball just inside the Villa half, played it off his knee and sent a 35-yard half-volley screaming past the despairing David James. But, with the driving mechanism effectively removed from Leeds's engine, O'Leary's team failed to capitalise against a Villa side who were themselves lacking Ian Taylor and Dion Dublin. Indeed, it took a staggering double-save from Nigel Martyn to prevent the scoreline embarrassing Leeds further. He kept out Merson's header from Steve Watson's cross with an acrobatic one-handed leap, before somehow deflecting a follow-up strike from George Boateng over his bar. Another Villa absentee, of course, was Gregory himself, currently serving a touchline ban that has coincided with an impressive run of 10 points in four games. \"I think it has been beneficial - the players certainly like it,\" said Gregory of his exile in the stand. \"It is something more intelligent managers than me do anyway, and something I'll continue with.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/match.sport4", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T20:37:53Z", "webTitle": "Derby raise a glass to Strupar's debut double", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport4", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport4", "fields": {"bodyText": "On screens around the ground before this match Derby's in-house television channel featured classic goals from Kevin Hector, Charlie George and Franny Lee. By the time Derby's next home match rolls round you can be sure Branko Strupar's first two goals in the Premiership will also be figuring prominently. Strupar, who joined Derby's United Nations squad last month for \u00a33m from Racing Club Genk, scored both their goals in their defeat of Watford. Derby badly needed someone of his quality after a depressing run of form which had seen them lose eight of their previous 10 Premiership matches and score just seven goals as they dropped into the bottom three. It took Strupar less than two minutes to start Derby's millennium on a brighter note. Avi Nimni had just wasted a good opportunity by dwelling on the ball too long when Rory Delap crossed the ball into the middle of Watford's defence. Robert Page and Steve Palmer made a hash of the clearance and when the ball found its way to Strupar on the edge of the penalty area he drilled a powerful shot past Alec Chamberlain. Watford had an opportunity to draw level within two minutes when Charlie Miller's deft ball caught out the Derby defence. But Michael Ngonge elected to try to lob Mart Poom rather than shoot low and the Estonian goalkeeper was able to claw his shot away. Watford never created such a clear chance again, leaving Taylor wishing he had someone of Strupar's class in his side. It was a message powerfully driven home when Strupar scored his second in the 72nd minute. If the first was mostly about sheer brawn, this one owed as much to subtlety. From a 20-yard free-kick, awarded for a foul by Page, he curled his shot around the wall and beyond Chamberlain. Strupar almost completed his hat-trick in the 89th minute when he pounced upon a mistake by Page and sped clear. But he squared to Marvin Robinson, whose shot was blocked. Unfortunately for Derby, Strupar is suspended for their next match because of a sending-off in Belgium. Their manager Jim Smith preferred instead to dwell on the victory which lifted his side out of the relegation zone. \"It was a big win for us,\" he admitted. \"Branko is a quality player although he finds it a lot quicker here than he did in Belgium. But he'll adjust.\" For Watford, who remain second from bottom, all their intensity did not translate itself into class. \"The last thing I would do is criticise the players for effort but the lack of quality is there for people to see,\" said Taylor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/match.sport5", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T20:43:36Z", "webTitle": "Gunners so wide of an easy target", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport5", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport5", "fields": {"bodyText": "Little more than 24 hours after touching down in Brazil, Sir Alex Ferguson and his Manchester United players are finding life a beach. With the champions away, Arsenal had the opportunity to plunder all they can only to be found wanting at the first obstacle. Eight years have past since Arsenal's last victory at Hillsborough but, with Sheffield Wednesday marooned, there can never have been a better chance to take advantage of United's absence. \"Bearing in mind Wednesday are bottom you can say we have dropped two points because one is not enough for us,\" admitted a rueful Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. The routine victory that had been expected of Arsenal seemed well on course when Emmanuel Petit put them ahead three minutes before the interval with a goal stunning in its creation and clinical in its execution. Thierry Henry's intelligent flick dissected the home defence and his compatriot was allowed to run unchallenged into the penalty area before enticing Pavel Srnicek from his goal line and expertly clipping the ball beyond him with the outside of his left boot. However, it was one of the few occasions when Arsenal exposed the gulf in ability against a side who have officially clocked up the worst start in Premiership history. Perhaps in Arsenal's case, more than most, this really is the dawning of a new era. Only David Seaman and Tony Adams merited a starting place from their famous back five until Mark Overmars was forced out after only 29 minutes, allowing Nigel Winterburn to restore a more customary look to the visiting side. Overmars had gone down in obvious distress following an innocuous challenge by Wim Jonk and his loss will be United's gain. \"He has an ankle problem and we will have to see how bad it is,\" said Wenger. A key component missing, Arsenal lacked their usual cohesion but remained largely untroubled until 11 minutes after the interval when Wednesday had the audacity to equalise. Ian Nolan's right-wing delivery hung in the air for an age and when it came down Gerald Sibon was at the far post to direct a firm header into the opposite corner. All of which begs the question as to why he has been so sparingly used since his \u00a32m arrival from Ajax last summer. \"You won't see a better header than that all season,\" said Wednesday's manager Danny Wilson. \"It's been a frustrating time for Gerald because he's not had many games but there are parts of his game that need working on\". It could have been even worse for Arsenal. As Wednesday flourished, the Londoners wilted and by the final whistle they were gratefully clinging on to their solitary point. Had Niclas Alexandersson's left-foot volley been a few inches to the left rather than striking the base of Seaman's left hand post, the most improbable of comebacks would have been complete. Arsenal also had their chances during a grandstand finish, most notably when Frederik Ljungberg's header was clawed away by Srnicek, but it was the hosts who finished with the greater verve and purpose. Nevertheless, they are surely doomed and a substantial contingent of the home fans held a minute's silence before kick-off to mark the demise of Wednesday's top-flight status. By the end, however, many questions hung over Arsenal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/match.sport6", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T20:59:07Z", "webTitle": "Hungry Spurs sense rich pickings", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport6", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport6", "fields": {"bodyText": "A win for Liverpool here yesterday might have taken them to third but they did not look quite ready for a place at the high table. Anfield's hopes of rejoining English football's elite have improved of late but on a sodden afternoon in north London Tottenham's pursuit of mere middle-class respectability turned out to be the stronger motivation. A firmly struck shot from Chris Armstrong midway through the first half brought Spurs the victory their better sense of purpose and direction deserved. It was Armstrong's 50th goal for the club, a landmark which would surely have been reached rather earlier had the player accepted more of the sort of chances he missed yesterday. Had Tottenham not won it would have been a palpable insult to the quality of service consistently provided by David Ginola, whose crossing regularly exposed a Liverpool defence which still has not rediscovered the knack of dealing with dangerous high balls. Ginola's importance to the result was underlined by the fact that for once he was not substituted and to the end remained Spurs' principal threat. This was only Liverpool's second defeat in 13 league games and their first since losing 1-0 at West Ham at the end of November. The absence of Michael Owen and Robbie Fowler, each suffering a recurrence of a recent injury, meant that however neat the build-up their attack was always likely to lack a punchline. But G\u00e9rard Houllier blamed the overall performance. \"Being without Owen and Fowler didn't help,\" the Liverpool manager admitted, \"but if you've got a good squad you have to overcome this. The fact was that I didn't recognise the team in the first half today. \"The character we had shown in away games wasn't there. There was an improvement in the second half but we have to admit that Tottenham wanted to win more than we did. They were first to the ball and created more chances.\" Certainly the pedigree of the opposition continues to bring out the best in George Graham's side at White Hart Lane. Creditable home victories over Manchester United, Arsenal and now Liverpool suggest that Tottenham are closer to becoming a serious force than they have been for some time. The 6-1 defeat Spurs suffered at Newcastle three days before Christmas appears to have jolted their system. Yesterday there was little doubting the players' desire to spend the rest of the season seeking the Uefa Cup place which should be well within their capabilities. The determination with which Spurs pursued victory kept the crowd in high optimism from first to last. Overall it was a fast, watchable encounter with Liverpool's patient, precise passing offering a sharp contrast to their opponents' swift, direct movements. In the absence of Owen and Fowler, Titi Camara became the focal point of Liverpool's attack. His battle of wits with Sol Campbell provided an intriguing contest within a contest and, while the England defender usually had Camara's measure, he was beaten often enough to set up the basis of a Liverpool win. But the closest Houllier's side came to scoring was in the 35th minute when Camara turned past Campbell and saw a shot parried by Ian Walker. Steven Gerrard, racing in, could only put the rebound into the side netting. By then Liverpool were chasing the game. Spurs' dominance of much of the match stemmed from the strength of Tim Sherwood in midfield supported solidly by Stephen Clemence and Luke Young. Dietmar Hamann and Jamie Carragher rarely matched the speed and tenacity of Tottenham's tackling which meant that Ginola, playing largely as an orthodox left-winger, saw a lot of the ball. This should have decided the contest by half-time but Armstrong failed to hit the target with three headers set up by the Frenchman's centres. Still, the Tottenham striker did take his goal sharply enough when the chance came. Houllier is still in need of a commanding figure at the back, especially in the air. Ginola had already made the point several times and, when a high deflection dropped towards Vegard Heggem, the Norwegian completely misjudged it and headed the ball straight to Armstrong, whose 25-yard drive left Sander Westerveld helpless."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/match.everton", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T21:02:32Z", "webTitle": "Depleted Leicester prevail as Elliott spoils Everton's party", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.everton", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.everton", "fields": {"bodyText": "Toffee or not toffee? Everton ended the millennium with a theatrical flourish at Goodison Park but started the new one with much less style. Bill Kenwright's entrance was marked by the five-goal destruction of Sunderland but Leicester made sure this was a much more prosaic performance from Everton in front of the watching impresario and owner-in-waiting. At least they preserved their unbeaten home record in the Premiership this season with an improved second half team display that earned the reward of a penalty equaliser from David Unsworth and a point to make it six matches without defeat. However, it was a point that looked unlikely for 20 minutes for half-time as Leicester, typically, made two route one attacks count through the considerable strength in the air of Matt Elliott. Leicester manager Martin O'Neill has constantly complained about a paper-thin squad and a long injury list but, in fact, it proved to be the main threat as his side ended a run of four Premiership defeats. Defender Elliott was pushed into an emergency role alongside Tony Cottee because of the injuries and the suspension to Emile Heskey, and the captain created all the damage. Indeed, Leicester's injury problems worsened in the sixth minute when keeper Tim Flowers was carried off on a stretcher - and taken to hospital with knee ligament trouble - after a collision with Nick Barmby, and replaced by Pegguy Arphexad. And it was the Frenchman whose long-range combination with Elliott produced Leicester's two first half goals after they fell behind in the 16th minute, when a 25-yard drive by David Weir hit Don Hutchison to end up in the back of the net, with the goal likely to be credited to the midfielder. Then the long-range one-two between the Leicester keeper and Elliott stunned the Everton crown in the 25th minute. Arphexad's long clearance was headed on by the Scottish international and he continued his run to pick up a ball from Theo Zagorakis and drill the equaliser passed Paul Gerrard. Weir missed the target badly from 15-yards a minute earlier for Everton and the error was punished severely again in the 32nd minute with Elliott featuring as maker and taker. Another long ball from Arphexah was headed on by Elliott and Cottee's nagging presence prompted a mix up between Dave Watson and Gerrard. Again Elliott profited with a goal. Everton went into shell after Leicester's equaliser but were handed a lifeline in the 57th minute when Frank Sinclair handled in the box and Unsworth stepped up to equalise from the spot. Everton honoured their 10 selected greatest players from the last century but manager Walter Smith acknowledged their performance did not match the memory of names like Dave Hickson, Alex Young and Howard Kendall. \"We didn't play well enough to claim that we should have won and we're all disappointed we didn't produce the level of performance we have in previous home matches,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/newsstory.sport", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T21:05:42Z", "webTitle": "Chaos as Maracana builds up for United", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/newsstory.sport", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/newsstory.sport", "fields": {"bodyText": "Judging by the chaos at the Maracana, the builders believe Manchester United kick off there not in two days but in two months.

No fewer than 500 people are trying to transform this crumbling concrete monster into a palace fit for the king of Fifa, Sepp Blatter, by Thursday night. \"It will be fully finished,\" a spokesman insisted.

An important Rio derby, such as Flamengo v Vasco da Gama, can attract crowds of that size. It may not be up to the standard of Old Trafford but, as John Barnes once recalled, that is not the point. Barnes, the scorer of a wonderful goal there for England in 1984, noted: \"Despite the awful facilities I was still treading the turf of the fabled Maracana, a name which always conjures up magic.

Playing a league game at Crewe while your hated rivals go for a clean sweep of international trophies after being crowned winners of everything worth winning in Europe would have been too much to bear. And that represents an improvement. The current crop of City youngsters is making a gallant effort to return the club to the heights it once ascended. Indeed City should have been making the short trip back up the M6 with all three points. It took a superb Rodney Jack goal to bring the home side a share of the spoils after a hard-fought match in slippery conditions finally took its toll on leg-weary players. Until then City had looked decent value to maintain their four-point lead at the First Division summit. But, boy, was it heavy going. Good passing football was in evidence despite the conditions. Indeed, the Crewe fan who was asked his postcode on collecting his tickets proved to be a diviner more accurate than Nostradamus. \"SK8,\" he said. How apt. But City adapted better to the conditions and it was from a heavily sanded quarter of the field that Bob Taylor sent Lee Crooks inside and the defender drove home a low 20-yarder that Jason Kearton will be disappointed about. He made amends a couple of times from Shaun Goater as the game fairly fizzed along and City's goalkeeper Nicky Weaver was also given the chance to show off his not inconsiderable talents. He produced a magnificently acrobatic stop to keep out Kevin Street's 20-yard curler as the first half drew to an exciting close. Apart from Jack's goal - a magnificent right-foot strike from the edge of the box after a rare Gerard Wiekens lapse - the second half failed to hit the same heights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "football/2000/jan/03/match.sport9", "type": "article", "sectionId": "football", "sectionName": "Football", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T21:18:54Z", "webTitle": "Hughes' instant hit buoys Blues", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport9", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2000/jan/03/match.sport9", "fields": {"bodyText": "When this fixture was first scheduled the smart money would have been on Birmingham to be the pacesetters and Huddersfield the also-rans. But the arrival of Steve Bruce as manager and an outlay of \u00a35m on new players had helped propel Huddersfield to second place prior to kick-off. In contrast City, who have suffered injuries that would tax the resources of most clubs, have slipped to 13th. Yesterday, though, pre-season predictions held sway at the expense of the mid-season formbook. Town, who lost to Charlton a week ago, experienced another setback in the race for the Premiership when they lost for the second game in a row. And it was a defeat that did not take long in coming. Just 12 seconds had elapsed when Bryan Hughes headed home Gary Rowett's right-wing cross for the country's first goal of the millennium to put the home side on course for their first win in five games. That set the pattern for the next hour, until a moment that Bruce felt was pivotal. Hitherto the City goalkeeper Ian Bennett had not had a save to make, but Bruce believed he should have been called into action in the 63rd minute when Marcus Stewart was bundled over by Darren Purse. \"As far as I'm concerned it was a blatant penalty,\" Bruce said. That apart Bruce had few complaints about his side's failure to win at the ground he graced as a player for two years. Neither did he have any complaints about the decision to disallow Clive Wijnhard's stooping header for offside. By then, though, City would have been safe had it not been for some smart defensive work by the visitors. The substitute John Dyson was on hand to clear a David Holdsworth shot off the line shortly after the break when Nico Vaesen was stranded, but Town's keeper did not need any assistance when he produced two fine saves to thwart Marcelo and Rowett. Ten minutes from time an even better save from Bennett to keep out Stewart's header ensured City earned a victory their endeavour deserved."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}, {"id": "sport/2000/jan/03/cricket2", "type": "article", "sectionId": "sport", "sectionName": "Sport", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-03T22:12:32Z", "webTitle": "Scorecard", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2000/jan/03/cricket2", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/sport/2000/jan/03/cricket2", "fields": {"bodyText": "India First Innings (overnight: 121-8) A Kumble c Langer b McGrath 26 J Srinath c Ponting b McGrath 3 B K V Prasad not out 1 Extras (12lb, 1w, 4nb) 17 Total (67.5 overs) 150 Fall cont: 126.

At night, troops worked more slowly than desired because they were not all equipped with night vision devices. \u0095 Communications Battle communications were a \"hindrance to operations\". Radio operators resorted to using code words and \"nick numbers\" to disguise sensitive security details because their broadcasts could be overheard by anyone with the right equipment. The Clansman radio equipment is \"old and unreliable\" with up to 35% of the units being repaired at any one time. The communications problems were made subject of an urgent request for a secure replacement system, but the equipment was \"not made available to the BG (battle group) before it left theatre,\" says Lt-Col Gibson's report. Brig Freer added that the communications situation was \"unworkable\" for \"anything other than a totally benign environment\". On ground-to-air communications, he wrote: \"We were fortunate that an inadequate system was not put to the test.\" \u0095 Intelligence Tactical intelligence available to the battle groups during the operation in Kosovo was \"disappointing\", according to the leaked reports. \"Considerable intelligence products were available to Nato but these were not disseminated to BG (battle group) level,\" they say. \"In particular, imagery obtained during the air campaign was over classified and consequently not released to BGs.\" They were also denied access to officers with local knowledge, such as those who had served on earlier Nato stints in Kosovo. \u0095 Families A lack of communication meant the families of serving personnel heard deployment details through the media rather than through official sources. Families found out about the initial deployment from the BBC 24 to 36 hours before soldiers had the decision confirmed by their chain of command. \u0095 Equipment A lack of equipment led to soldiers sleeping on floors and rarely being able to take a shower during deployment in Pristina. Many troops purchased their own solar shower bags and camp beds \"to improve their living conditions\", said the leaked reports. Members of the 1st Battalion Parachute Regiment bought their own global positioning satellite receivers because there were not enough to go around. There was also a shortage of other items of equipment, such as \"plasticuffs\" for use in public order situations. \u0095 Spin-doctoring One of the reports seems to suggest that \"spin-doctoring\" of the Kosovo campaign by the ministry of defence led to a lot of time being wasted. Lt-Col Gibson wrote that while most media coverage was supportive, \"on the few occasions when adverse articles might have been written, there seemed to be concern and subsequently disproportionate command and staff effort expended over the potential implications of such articles. \"This may be a product of MOD 'spin-doctoring'. \"Commanders and staff need to be much more positive in the face of the media.\" Lt-Col Gibson advocated full co-operation with the media and said \"black-listing\" of news organisations who were not supportive \"denied them access to stories and was an effective solution\". \"Soldiers dealing within the BG were continually briefed on the pitfalls when dealing with the press. Experience suggested that journalists are usually delighted to be spoon-fed with direction, advice and, on occasions, copy.\" \u0095 Command A delay in dividing responsibilities between the national forces and K-For \"meant that soldiers were initially operating in something of a vacuum which lasted for several days\", said the reports. The chain of command left much to be desired. Brigadier Freer commented: \"A clear chain of command is a basic principle of military operations and the blurred lines which existed only served to cause confusion.\" The \"confused and fractured\" lines of command \"may have had a damaging effect on morale\", adds the report. The situation eroded troops' confidence in the chain of command and had the potential to place individual soldiers in \"an invidious position\". \u0095 Legal powers Soldiers in Operation Agricola were not made aware of their legal powers before being deployed in Pristina, says one of the reports. It paints a picture of a confused and legally toothless military force. The report adds: \"Appropriate advice was slow to arrive. Advice often dodged the issue referring the matter back to the judgment of the soldier on the ground. \"There was much discussion about law and legal procedures but little application of justice. There seemed to be a great fear of both adverse publicity and the possibility of future litigation. Suspected war criminals could only be detained for a few hours before they had to be released.\" Lt-Col Gibson added that the Albanian community, in particular, meted out violence on Serbs \"sure in the knowledge that the BG (battle group) was impotent to do anything to stop them\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}, {"id": "money/2000/jan/04/workandcareers.madeleinebunting", "type": "article", "sectionId": "money", "sectionName": "Money", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-04T00:00:00Z", "webTitle": "Have you got those back-to-work blues?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/jan/04/workandcareers.madeleinebunting", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2000/jan/04/workandcareers.madeleinebunting", "fields": {"bodyText": "1.

It's one of the lesser-known symbols of human independence that virtuosi who can play the daylights out of conventional music choose to travel such off-the-wall routes, and at the start of a new century the Vortex's now established new year improv-party had an even more anti-monolithic vibe than usual. Pianist and architect of the day's events, Veryan Weston, promised that the opening duo of Alan Tomlinson (trombone) and Dave Tucker (guitar) would blow the morning-after cobwebs away. The words had barely left his lips before Tomlinson unleashed a bone-rattling blast that rivalled the celebratory detonations of a few hours before. If the first salvo had set the audience rocking backwards in their chairs, it was soon clear that Tomlinson's remarkable range and musicality stretches way beyond noise-making. It was also clear that the resourceful guitarist Tucker was as likely to slip in bluesy chord patterns, bottleneck effects or gallumphing Munsters-rhythms as the abstract, Derek Bailey-like approach to melody he also favours. Veryan Weston and the great South African drummer Louis Moholo played an exquisite short set of sweeping, liquid chordal effects backed by lightly rustling mallet patterns, and the saxophone virtuoso John Butcher - a highly individual descendant of the multilinear sax school of Evan Parker - delivered two completely different free ruminations on soprano and then on tenor. The Thelonious Monkish melodic ideas and coolly grooving jazzy vocals of pianist Steve Beresford's larger ensemble Signals for Tea at first sounded like a band in the wrong room after so much activity away from the beaten track, but the fine drummer Mark Sanders kept it light and graceful, and there were engagingly circuitous solos from the inventive Beresford and saxophonist Jason Yarde, and increasingly affable ones from trumpeter Harry Beckett once he warmed to the task.

While London was observing the bank holiday, investors in continental Europe kicked off in jubilant mood, with share prices in Paris and Frankfurt quickly setting records. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones moved sharply higher at the outset, while the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index jumped 3%. However, the Dow closed down 139, or more than 1%, to 11,357 as financial services companies were hit hard by fears of a rate increase when the Federal Reserve's policy setting committee next meets in February. Although the Nasdaq had opened up 115 points, it fell to minus 50 and then finally ended the day up 61 points. The swings marked the technology-driven market's 25th most volatile trading day ever. Henry Blodget, the internet analyst at Merrill Lynch, was one of several analysts surprised by the volatility. He said that while institutional investors were wary of rising interest rates, they had delayed buying shares until after the threat of Y2K was over. In Europe, France's CAC-40 index lost almost 1% on the day and Germany's Dax index ended 3% lower in what dealers described as \"thin and jittery\" trading. Analysts noted that the US central bank had cited concerns about the possible impact of Y2K when it failed to raise rates in December. The Fed, which has recently increased domestic money supply to meet the potential demand for more cash over the holiday period, is expected to soak up some of the spare capital in the system. Doug Cliggott, US equity strategist at JP Morgan, said: \"After being very generous... things should return to normal for the Fed, and that implies a tighter monetary policy.\" Ian Shepherdson, analyst at High Frequency Economics, warned that such \"skittish\" market behaviour was likely to continue for the next three months as extra mutual fund money and continued bullishness about the internet contrasted with rate fears. He said yesterday's downturn was understandable. \"The market had a collective realisation that the Fed is now free to do whatever it wants to interest rates. The correction was much more logical than the rally.\" Financial services companies caused most of the Dow's decline with American Express accounting for almost one-third of it. US treasury bills were also hit hard by a report yesterday pointing to higher inflation. The benchmark 30-year bond suffered its second-biggest price decline since August as the National Association of Purchasing Managers report showed the 11th factory price increase in as many months. A number of America's best-known internet companies managed to buck the trend. Amazon.com and eBay stood out after these two e-commerce groups drew the heaviest holiday traffic, according to a league table from Media Metrix, a net researcher. In London, the Bank of England was able to issue a statement declaring all money markets around the world had opened for business without any Y2K-related problems being reported. \"The providers of financial infrastructure, such as exchanges, clearing houses and settlement systems, tested systems to pre-planned timetables over the weekend,\" the Bank said. \"Reports of progress against milestones continue to indicate that the financial sector is on track for a smooth opening of sterling markets [today].\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}, {"id": "money/2000/jan/04/business.personalfinancenews", "type": "article", "sectionId": "money", "sectionName": "Money", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-04T00:00:00Z", "webTitle": "More jobs at B&Q as DIY market gows", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/jan/04/business.personalfinancenews", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/money/2000/jan/04/business.personalfinancenews", "fields": {"bodyText": "Kingfisher, the retailing group which includes Woolworths and Comet, yesterday promised to create more than 2,000 jobs in its home improvements division.

The group, whose do-it-yourself operations expanded with the Castorama merger in France, has been capitalising on the public appetite for home and garden improvement and claims to be the clear leader in the European DIY market. George Bramhill, personnel director of B&amp;Q, said the company had added some 5,500 jobs in the past three years.

Philip Mellor, senior analyst at D&amp;B, said any real effects of the bug would be worsened by unscrupulous companies using the bug as an excuse for not paying bills on time. \"'The cheque has been lost in the computer' could be as familiar an excuse as 'the cheque has been lost in the post,\"' Mr Mellor said. But while the number of business failures is forecast to rise at first in 2000, the economic recovery will reverse the trend in the second half of the year, Mr Mellor said. When D&amp;B's figures are broken down quarter by quarter the number of business failures was already seen to be edging back down in the last three months of 1999 and the economy bounced back from its recent slowdown. \"From past experience it takes at least a year for an upturn in the economy to reduce the number of business failures,\" Mr Mellor added. The pattern of company closures varied from region to region, adding weight to arguments that the UK has suffered from a two speed economy over the last year.

We might dwell on that, might see the little bird as almost an incidental character in the photograph, except when you register the shaky image you realise you have never seen a photograph in which a bird seemed so conscious. Alfred Hitchcock wouldn't have liked this show. Mylayne's big colour pictures of birds are intimate encounters, photographic equivalents of the moment David Attenborough was admitted into a family of gorillas. Mylayne is a romantic who insists these are not objective studies of another species, but subjective records of his relationship with animals he believes have a right to individuated portraits. Mylayne's pictures are the fruit of field trips in which he befriends birds to the extent that a mother lets him photograph next to the nest as she feeds her young. He selects the scene - a muddy pool, a thicket - arranges it with artificial lighting, then waits for his particular befriended bird to flit into view. We see a synthesis of animal and artist: the world blown up huge, a thicket become a forest, a field an ocean, water and sky merging without up or down. To grasp his work's strangeness you have only to compare it with mainstream wildlife photography. Animals have been exposed to the camera since the 19th century in the name of objective knowledge and sentimental pleasure, but always as objects, as creatures without consciousness. There seems no limit to the animal spectacles we can catch on camera, from Eadweard Muybridge's photographs of horses in motion to the BBC's Walking With Dinosaurs, which proved that, even after being dead for millions of years, animals can still be photographed and filmed for our delight. Mylayne's photographs are not documentary. He doesn't name species and instead captions them with the number of months he spent on each. The way he lives - spending his time following his subjects like a migratory bird - is part of their meaning. In one, a bird poses above its own reflection in a muddy pool. The bird might be studying its reflection or studying him. We are transported.

Not even the takeover fever which continued to grip the banking sector could rival the gravity-defying performance of shares in telecoms and new technology in 1999. Investor imagination was ignited by the world's largest hostile bid, staged for Germany's Mannesmann by Vodafone AirTouch, the huge British group which is also working with compatriot BT to divvy up the spoils in Spain by seizing control of Airtel, that country's second-largest mobile phone group. A lack of exposure to these soaraway sectors means that the Guardian's portfolio of share tips was sadly uninspiring in 1999, after an impressive 48% return the year before. The eventual arrival of a new Canadian chief executive for Barclays Bank, after Martin Taylor had unexpectedly quit last winter, gave some vigour by helping to lift the banking group's shares from \u00cb12.96 to \u00cb17.82. That 37.5% gain over the year combined with a 31.5% rise in the price of the software and consultancy group Admiral to give zest to our share tips for the year. The takeover of another of the Guardian's picks of 1999, Select Appointments, which was acquired by Holland's Vedior in a \u00cb1.1bn deal in September, was a bonus to the portfolio, as well as to Martin Pestalozzi, the Swiss staffing entrepreneur who had rescued the company from the brink of insolvency in the early 1990s. Elsewhere, however, the investment climate was less kind to shares - particularly those which are among the mainstays of modern life: water, cigarettes and booze. Imperial Tobacco fell by 134p to 510p after suffering from the fall-out from the fear of renewed litigations, problems in developing markets and a failure to cement the promised growth through acquisition. Most of all, however, the company suffered because it is not a high technology operator. The Hilton Group, formerly Ladbroke, did not realise the bounce back which we had anticipated following the sale of the Coral betting chain, although it was not alone as a member of the distinctly unloved leisure sector.

It is complete with lovely costumes, olde worlde sets that make Edwardian London look like a dead ringer for the market square at Chessington World of Adventures, a roller-skating Tinkerbell and lots of nicely behaved performing children. There are some silly moments. Even the three-year-old next to me could see that Peter Pan does have a shadow when he says he's lost it (sort out that lighting, folks) and the bit of audience participation with children from the stalls is like Kids Say the Cutest Things only more insulting to everyone's intelligence, particularly the children. But this is a really slick and professional show that in its own way has enough magic to create a memory for any child. If Leslie Grantham's Captain Hook isn't nearly villainous enough, Bonnie Langford proves why she's the best panto principal boy ever, playing to the gallery and bringing an irrepressible spirit and acrobatic flying to Peter. Please God, may Bonnie Langford never grow too old to be a principal boy and can I always believe in fairies. \u0095 Till January 23.

Legs and feet constituted the 'mechanical part' of the art, while the face and arms expressed its 'soul'. Not surprisingly, this opinion hasn't lasted, for what most obviously distinguishes dance from the other performing arts is that it gets around on its feet. Music, singing, acting and reciting can all be done on the spot. Dance, uniquely, makes beauty out of covering ground, which is why dancers' feet are objects of such fascination. The ballerina's foot, in particular, is a breed apart from the ordinary mortal's. Her pointed toe is a potent image of her erotic and exotic otherness. It is the miraculously fine base on which she balances, creating the gravity-defying illusion that allows her to transform into sylph, princess or superwoman. It is the exquisite instrument with which she articulates the detail of classical footwork, and it is the source of intense dramatic contrast - stabbing the floor, caressing the air, quivering with a kind of blind physical intelligence. Yet it's also a valiantly hard-working body part. On this small, complex construction of bone, muscle and tendon the entire weight of the dancer frequently has to rest, and the foot pays a price. Professional dancers are usually loath to show them to outsiders, for the damage and distortion can be shocking. Strip away the ballerina's satin slipper and you'll often find a mess of bunions, blisters, corns and crooked toes. Sarah Wildor, principal dancer with the Royal Ballet, says wistfully: 'My feet might have been quite nice if I hadn't been a dancer.' Her special source of martyrdom is the corns that grow between her toes, due to the pressure placed on the bones. She trims the corns to keep them under control, but she has 'a really horrible soft one, between the fourth and fifth toes' whose only effective treatment would be an operation to shave the bone. If dancers' feet are studied through a medical scan, even worse damage becomes visible. Lucy Haith, head of physiotherapy at the Royal, says such a scan will show up all areas of potential or actual stress fracture to the bone and, while a normal person's should reveal none, a classical dancer's will typically reveal several. 'Dancers bear their weight through the tips of two toes - the big toe and the second toe - and obviously we weren't designed to do that,' she says. 'But stress fractures are caused not only by dancing on point but also by jumping. Athletes have highly designed shoes to absorb the shock of landing; dancers wear nothing to minimise the impact.' Add to this the frequent hazard of tendinitis (inflamed or swollen tendons) and you have a chiropodist's nightmare. The Royal, like any sensible ballet company, doesn't encourage suffering. Dancers are instructed to get their feet, or any part of their body, looked at as soon as they feel any pain. Yet ever since Marie Taglioni and her early-19th-century sisters first hoisted themselves up on the tips of their toes, masochism has been part of the ballerina's image. We read with awe of Taglioni being drilled by her father to fainting point in order to master the technique of toe dancing, of Anna Pavlova exiting the stage and leaving a trail of bloody footprints. In Taglioni's era, dancers didn't even have blocked shoes to support their endeavours, merely lines of darning to stiffen the toes of their slippers. Today's ballerinas have slightly more to stand on. The boxed toe of the modern shoe is constructed out of tightly packed layers of wadding and shellac that provides a tiny platform on which to balance. But while this greatly enhances the technical possibilities of pointwork, it doesn't magic away the pain. Wildor admits that her feet are 'agony really. During a performance the pain is the last thing on my mind but when I come off stage my feet are killing me.' Darcey Bussell agrees that 'you basically numb your mind to the pain'. She has an easier time than Wildor - 'I can go for up to three days without my feet really hurting' - but she has a nasty bunion, which she has to keep strapped up and frequently bleeds, and the inevitable blisters where her skin is rubbed raw. For prepubescent ballet students the blood that's drawn from their first chafing, wobbling efforts to stand on point is, however, a mark of maturity. Bleeding blisters and bunions are the stigmata of the profession, and the most enthusiastic fans covet the worn, stained shoes in which a favourite dancer has performed. So crucial is the ballerina's point shoe to her image that when early 20th-century choreographers rebelled against ballet they danced in bare feet. No longer shod in delicate satin, no longer poised in the act of flight, Martha Graham and other pioneers of modern dance proclaimed themselves women of the earth. Their bare feet were firmly on the floor, providing leverage for the dancers' bold, blunt, passionate moves. They were also styled in stark opposition to classical feet, flexed rather than pointed, placed parallel rather than turned out. For years, modern choreography was popularly referred to as barefoot dancing, for that naked, unadorned foot symbolised the emotional and physical frankness of the whole aesthetic. In the 60s, when a new wave of minimalists aimed to democratise dance, the look of the foot was crucial. Graham's bare foot had a religious high tone about it, so 60s dancers wore sneakers and rarely stylised their feet into flexed or pointed shapes. The image was casual and functional. Then in the 80s, when choreographers invented the urban, gutsily physical style of Eurocrash, the Doc Marten became the footwear of choice. Dancers shod in these tough, clunky shoes could stamp and kick as hard as they liked, and the noise they made added dramatically to the energy of their moves. Yet the use of the foot as percussive instrument is as old as dance itself. Black African dance, tap dance, clog dance, Irish dance, south Asian dance - all these genres work the feet as a drumming accompaniment. While ballet dancers aim for an otherworldy silence, many other dancers wear shoes to maximise their noise. The metal caps favoured by tap and Irish dance are contrived to rap out every shuffle, tap and stamp as loudly as possible - with productions such as Riverdance using a miked stage to intensify the sound. Many south Asian dancers wear bells around their ankles for a similar effect, yet it's amazing how much sound they can produce from stamping out their percussive moves with bare feet. Choreographer Shobana Jeyasingh says that stamping is the wrong verb: 'What we do is more like clapping - we clap the air with our feet.' To do this correctly the feet have to be relaxed, so that they feel no pain. However, it requires a tremendous amount of power and some dancers suffer from fallen arches as a result. Others find knees and lower backs are affected by the strain. In fact, they can't wear shoes at all. Most south Asian dance forms originated in the temples, where shoes were removed as a mark of respect. Even today, it's considered sacrilege to dance in shoes, and this ban gave Jeyasingh huge problems when her company took part in the grand parade in Paris marking the bicentenary of the French revolution. She couldn't let her dancers go barefoot down the Champs Elys\u00e9es, yet she could hardly put them in trainers. She compromised by putting them in tiny slipperettes, which were camouflaged by patterns of henna. When word got out in Indian dance circles, Jeyasingh was castigated by some diehard purists - and her dilemma oddly reverses that of revolutionary ballet choreographer Mikhail Fokine in 1907. He had created a ballet in which the dancers were to perform barelegged and barefoot, but the management of the Imperial Ballet in St Petersburg thought this such an affront to the dignity of the artform they forced the dancers into tights with toenails painted on. Slippered or naked, pointed or flexed, the foot still has the power to bewitch and to shock. It is not only the defining image of different styles of dance - it is also the focus of dance's mystique. \u0095 Darcey Bussell and Sarah Wildor's feet can be seen in the Royal Ballet's Nutcracker, at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (0171-304 4000), till January 10.

And the star would undoubtedly be Norman Rosenthal, exhibitions secretary since 1977, and a bit of a character. When I meet Rosenthal before opening time at Burlington House he sets everything up in the most theatrical way. The press officer can't find him. His secretary says that often before the exhibitions open you'll find him in one of the rooms enjoying the art. And there he is, artfully slumped on a leather couch in front of a wall of Van Dyck portraits. 'I come here every morning and walk around talking to these people,' he says. 'That's my privilege, a fantastic privilege.' The Royal Academy is a perverse British institution, and Norman Rosenthal is a perverse institutional figure. You can't imagine him anywhere else. The Tate would never have put on Sensation!, the exhibition of Charles Saatchi's collection the Academy mounted in 1997: how could the Tate have allowed Saatchi to stamp himself on history in that way? But Rosenthal had no qualms about importing all this stuff into the sacred halls of Burlington House, and for many Sensation! is the defining exhibition of young British art, not only here but in America. In his office is a framed front page of the New York Post leading with mayor Giuliani's attempt to ban the show last year. 'I was at the opening [at the Brooklyn Museum]. All the glamorous people were there - Hugh Grant' But, he says, no protesters at all. 'I was almost disappointed. The whole thing took place not in real people's experience but in the cliches of politicians and journalists. That's so boring. Art is beyond that.' This denial of a desire to create a stir is frankly unbelievable. Rosenthal is the epitome of the art curator as showman, an instigator of huge blockbuster exhibitions that make bold statements about contemporary art and art history and address those statements to a broad public. The titles of his exhibitions capture the scale of his ambition. A New Spirit in Painting (1981), British Art in the 20th Century (1987), Zeitgeist and Metropolis (both 1991). Then of course there was the Royal Academy's smash hit of last year, Monet in the 20th Century. The Monet exhibition (which he programmed rather than curated) looked disturbingly like a prophecy of what art will become in the 21st century: less an art exhibition than an anthropology of class and taste in contemporary Britain as it exploded into a must-see event that systematically filtered through as many people as possible. Rosenthal's shows have helped to define British culture now, making the exhibition a phenomenon, a public ritual. They have prepared the way for the great exhibitions set to dominate cultural life in 2000 - the show at the Dome, the new displays of modern art opening at Tate Modern in May, not to mention huge shows at the Royal Academy beginning with this month's 1900: Art at the Crossroads, a massive survey of the art scene 100 years ago. Since he became exhibitions secretary more than 20 years ago, Rosenthal has turned the Royal Academy into a venue for event art. Buzz, hype, noise, crowds are what this purportedly posh and staid organisation thrives on. When I bring up Monet, Rosenthal seems almost embarrassed by the show's popularity - 'It is to me a rather marvellous mystery as to why Monet has this status.' But did an exhibition that turned into such a people-moving machine give audiences a chance to be with the art in the silent, contemplative way Monet surely expected? Well, for one viewer there was solitude aplenty. 'For me Monet was a great privilege. Another reason I love to do exhibitions is to be alone with them. You know, I feel like an amazing collector.' He interrupts the interview to debate with the director of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, who is enjoying a private view of the Van Dyck, about whether - as Rosenthal believes - the Flemish portraitist was one of the five greatest artists ever. The man from the Fitz says no, not really. Rosenthal comments that he never studied art history formally. He studied history at Leicester University in the 60s but got a summer job at Agnew's, the art dealers, and worked on the catalogue for a Van Dyck show. From that point on he became addicted to art, including contemporary art. 'I don't accept the idea that art is over and past ages were better or worse, because they were just different. I think those who are only involved in contemporary art miss out and those who are only involved with the world of Old Masters miss out.' Rosenthal's distinctive sensibility also has roots in his background. His parents were German and Czech Jewish immigrants. When he became exhibitions officer at the ICA in 1973 his knowledge of German meant he was sent abroad to programme the German Month. Rosenthal brought over Joseph Beuys, one of the artists he feels most deeply about. He has what he calls a second life in Berlin (as well as a wife and children in Madrid) and has programmed exhibitions in Germany with his friend Christos Joachimides. The exhibition that made his name and turned the RA from a fusty institution to one of the world's great exhibition spaces was Post-Impressionism in 1979, a highly influential show that popularised revisionist approaches to art history. Post-Impressionism was a label coined by the critic Roger Fry to describe the modern art that came between Impressionism and Picasso. Rosenthal's exhibition deconstructed the idea of this 'movement' by revealing the huge range of art being made in France in the period and showing that it was plural and very complex. The upcoming 1900: Art at the Crossroads, which he has co-curated with an international team including the art historian Robert Rosenblum, is a similarly deconstructive survey. It displays the massive range of art at the beginning of the modernist era, from the sublime (C\u00e9zanne, Picasso, Matisse) to the ridiculous (some amazingly naff salon artists). It may be fascinating, or it may just be exhausting. 'We're trying to demonstrate that at that moment many options were open to the world of art,' says Rosenthal. This desire to illustrate a 'moment' is what he says all his exhibitions do. Not to say one artist is better, one movement more significant, but to 'gather', as he puts it, art's rich history. The strength of Rosenthal's work as a curator is that it makes art feel important and public and exciting - an event, something everyone has to engage with, or in the case of Sensation!, argue about. A good Royal Academy show is like one imagines a Paris salon in the 19th century to have been: art at the centre of city life. The danger of blockbuster exhibitions is that they might kill the thing they love. If you don't argue for one artist or movement being more important than another, you end up reducing art to a consumer choice. And there's one art for the curator and those lucky enough to attend a private view, another for the people queuing in the rain and paying for a Monet brioche. 'One thing about the Royal Academy is that one is always condemned to be grand,' admits Rosenthal. 'The Royal Academy is a great tribune,' he says in an oddly archaic turn of language, 'and one has to treat it like that. The rooms are so noble and splendid and so grand.' His exhibitions play this up and relish it. Spectacle, scale and sensation are what you get. He's a showman and he feels an empathy with another showman, Damien Hirst, whom he praises for hugely expanding the audience for contemporary art in Britain. This year Rosenthal plans another big contemporary art show, another attempt to define the zeitgeist - from the man who once staged an exhibition called Zeitgeist. It's time for the Royal Academy to open its doors, and a couple of curious heads peep into Rosenthal's lair. 'The punters are arriving', he says, 'so maybe we should withdraw.' \u0095 1900: Art at the Crossroads runs from January 16 till April 3 at the Royal Academy, Burlington House, Piccadilly, London W1 (0171-300 8000)."}, "isHosted": false}, {"id": "business/2000/jan/04/1", "type": "article", "sectionId": "business", "sectionName": "Business", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-04T01:16:23Z", "webTitle": "Electrolux hit by \u00a318m trading scam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2000/jan/04/1", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/business/2000/jan/04/1", "fields": {"bodyText": "Rogue trading in foreign currencies has blown a \u00a317m hole in the accounts of Electrolux, the consumer appliances giant, it emerged last night.

'Electrolux has initiated an investigation with the help of its auditors and legal advisers and will take all appropriate legal actions,' the company said. Unauthorised speculations in foreign currency began on the employee's own initiative early last year, and, as losses mounted, he increased his trading activity while taking action to hide from his superiors what was going on, Electrolux said. The employee worked in Germany, hitherto the base for the group's internal banking activity, managing liquidity, short-term borrowing and the foreign exchange transactions needed to finance German imports. In the wake of the scandal, Electrolux said it would now centralise all forward-contract trading at its treasury department in Stockholm. The losses are thought to total about 55m marks, and Electrolux said it was unsure as to the extent of its insurance cover against rogue trading.

Like my sister, I found them rather gloomy - full of churches and ruins and bridges and all the things that grown-ups seemed to find interesting, instead of clowns and bright colours and dogs. So it was a tremendous shock to find myself recently at a posh launch party in London's Bond Street, with a book called FL Griggs: The Architecture of Dreams on sale, and all over these walls the same etchings that my mother owned, but with expensive price labels beside them. As the guests talked about 'a neglected English visionary', 'the upholder of the great English rural tradition', blah blah blah, it slowly dawned on me that my grandfather - 'Da' - must be famous. When one of the curators of the Griggs exhibition now on at the Ashmolean in Oxford told me that a 1974 show of Da's work had been the museum's 'most successful exhibition ever', the realisation was complete. I don't think I'd ever looked closely at the dark pictures that Da specialised in. His biographer, Jerrold Northrop Moore, says that Griggs should be rated in the same way as Chopin: as a specialist of genius, Chopin's instrument being the piano, and my grandfather's being his etching tools. But Da also specialised in subject, refusing, as far as I can see, to work on anything except landscape, refusing even to acknowledge the existence of colour, and certainly refusing to admit the presence of the modern world. Although the period in which his reputation was at his highest, between the two world wars, was a time of incredible social upheaval, his etchings could have been made in a monastery. There are no motor cars, no factory chimneys, no city bustle: instead he imagined another England, building huge castles and medieval cities from ruins. I can see not a single reference to the 20th century in his entire output. My mother had told us that he was associated with the arts and crafts tradition: he moved to Chipping Camden at the turn of the century partly because of its association with the movement, and was supported and encouraged throughout his career by Sidney Cockerell, who had been William Morris's secretary. As children we loved hearing the romantic bits of his life: how he met my grandmother and got engaged after five weeks, and wrote in his diary 'Too great a gift'; how he bankrupted himself buying Dover's Hill near Chipping Camden to preserve it from having a hotel put on it, and then gave the hill to the National Trust; how he further impoverished himself by building a house (New Dover's House) and insisting that every single detail, every stone, every shelf, be perfect in accordance with his love of medieval England. Seeing his work in the Ashmolean (it is not a very big exhibition, just a corner of the museum) brings home the obsessiveness of his work. He has hatched in the stones and turrets and gargoyles of every building with an attention to detail that could almost be seen as obsessive. But the biography brings home another side of his life: the man I never knew, because my mother had so few memories of him. His father was a baker, and Da was sacked from his first job as a clerk to a flour miller for 'filling up the ledgers with sketches and caricatures'. There's a terrifying bit on page 58 where he proposes to some woman called Winifred: for a split second visions of parallel universes whirl around my head, where my grandfather married this woman, never met my grandmother, never had my mother and I never existed. Luckily she chucks him a few pages later. He sounds like an odd man, an interesting man: JB Priestley, a friend, described him as 'a Catholic, a medievalist, a craftsman who would have all men craftsmen, a thorough hater of all things modern.' My mum always talked about the brilliant games he would set up for her and her sisters and brother. My grandmother remained a widow for 50 years after his death. It is odd, 34 years after someone has died, and taken their jokes and crankinesses and preoccupations with them, to suddenly want to meet them.

He was, he claims, immediately subject to a campaign of police harassment - his home and office were ransacked, his car tampered with, his life threatened. He felt that living in the US was like living in a concentration camp. Finally, in the summer of 1997, he flew to Sweden, where he now lives underground, having run away from a refugee reception area. My third New Year's Eve underground brings a frozen landscape of iced forests and snow-covered vistas. The sun will occasionally appear, its shimmering, crystalline beauty given an illusion of warmth, but the thermometer dips to minus 35 degrees. It doesn't take long for the cold to bite at your extremities, the air tickling your nose as it freezes any moisture it encounters. Yet harsh as this life may be, it remains infinitely preferable to the life I endured in the States, the life to which I know I would be returned if the Swedish police were to arrest and deport me. In July 1997, I stood at New York's Kennedy Airport clutching a ticket to Sweden. I called a few friends to make my farewells, thinking this may be the last time I would see my home. As hard as things were in America, it was not easy to say goodbye. But my life as a refugee had really already begun in my home country after I had organised a police accountability hearing in my home state of Connecticut and my home and offices were destroyed in retaliation. That year, I spent the holidays alone at a hotel, virtually under siege. I found myself increasingly alone. Those in stronger minority communities have often come together against acts of police abuse - remember the riots that followed the beating of Rodney King? But mainstream America has never mobilised when the target of abuse is someone white and well-off. It is paradoxical that, in a country in which many believe police abuse has reached epidemic proportions, so many victims become increasingly isolated and are treated as lepers. In the summer of 1997, I began to realise just how isolated I'd become. Life's most simple pleasures - a home, a relaxed meal, companionship, shopping, even a walk in the park - were denied me. Unpredictable daily assaults left me a ghost among the living. My world was steadily being destroyed and there was nothing I could do to stop it. Those few friends who had stood by me now urged me to flee, for my own safety. Eventually, the realisation that there was no possibility of domestic protection led me to begin the journey I continue today. At many points, all that had kept me going was the thought that I had to endure, not for myself, but for the same reasons others throughout history have found ways to endure for their country - it was very difficult to leave. On the plane, safe for the first time in recent memory, I made an effort to put the past behind me. I arrived at Stockholm's Arlanda airport knowing no one, but I contacted a local chapter of Amnesty International and the following week met with their Swedish section. With their help, I found legal counsel and became acquainted with the political asylum issues I faced. Then, shortly after my arrival in Sweden, I applied for political asylum. I was informed that many who do so are immediately incarcerated and sent back on the earliest plane, but I was fortunate in that I had masses of evidence of what had happened to me in the States. While awaiting the outcome of my application, I was assigned a place in the Carlsund refugee camp outside Stockholm. Carlsund is a processing centre for refugees entering the country (I had entered as a tourist). I was later told it was the best of the country's camps. It is made up of low-lying brick buildings, set among greenery and groves of mature trees. That summer, wild flowers grew everywhere and as I watched children playing along the wooded pathways, I reflected that, compared with many of those in America's inner cities, they were lucky. At Carlsund, organised recreation, a gym, cooked meals and clean facilities were provided. I was assigned to a room in a dormitory called Club. Except for those refugees who were held in a unit called X-House, we were free to come and go as we pleased; many, like me, travelled regularly to Stockholm. After a few weeks of 'processing', I and many others were transferred to Flenn, a camp where the showers reeked of human waste and conditions can best be described as difficult. Everything that Carlsund was, Flenn was not, although, in all fairness, I did find many of the staff both sensitive and deeply committed. Most of the other refugees at the camps were from Iraq, Iran, the former Soviet Union, the Balkans, Africa and Afghanistan. I was the only American, of course, and more than a few of both camps' residents were not fond of the States. Many, notably the Afghanis and Iraqis, expressed a belief that they had become little more than pawns in America's political struggles and they harboured deep-felt resentment. My first days had some interesting moments, but even across the barriers of culture and language, understandings can be reached. In Carlsund and later Flenn, I soon found myself on friendly terms with a number of other refugees. Although my background was very different from their own, we shared a common bond in that we had escaped those who had sought to kill us. We considered ourselves members of a special club. When it appeared that I might be deported, there were those among them who provided a way to contact local activists, affording me a chance to escape the fate my return to the US would mean. In mid-September of 1997, after preparations had been pursued with the refugee group FARR (the Swedish Network of Asylum and Refugee Groups), I left Flenn and made my way to a pre-arranged location in Stockholm. Officially, I was in the city for a visit; when, days later, my asylum application was rejected, I entered life underground. I had been given the name and phone number of a young activist who had offered to shelter me. I called him and we arranged to meet at a subway station. Instead I was met by another activist and my circumstances reviewed, in detail, before I was finally allowed to meet my prospective host. Those working in the underground here are careful: they do not like to make mistakes. In Sweden, for asylum seekers facing deportation, going underground is the only option. Since October 1997, I have been hidden by activists all around the country. What that means is living and travelling with people who only minutes before were strangers, moving regularly to avoid detection and living in the shadows as a virtual fugitive. The Swedish police have an order for my arrest and deportation. In those first days, I stayed in Stockholm with groups of young activists; I slept on couches and in closets, but I was free. Since then, I have lived in a typical Swedish home, in a dilapidated house in the woods, even in a 50-room castle. It is surprising how many people I have met here who share a commitment to seeing justice done and who have chosen to help. My hosts have ranged from the young and struggling to comfortably-off, middle-aged professionals. Living as an underground exile, the only reason I am alive today is because of them. As an American, I stand out, so most opportunities for 'off the books' employment are denied me and I exist on the generosity of others. People I have never met but who have become familiar with my circumstances have taken considerable risks and expended more than a little time, effort and money on my behalf. Through the 'little victories' their sacrifices have brought, I am able to continue. Here in underground exile, one is forced to acknowledge that everything you ever knew and worked for has effectively been stolen from you, even your name - I must live under an assumed one. The press has noted that I was once a self-made millionaire, having built a successful business in addition to a police reform movement, but now, as a non-person in hiding, I have no opportunity to start anew. Having a driver's licence, a bank account or a business all require that a person officially exists - I do not. I have been described as 'the man who fled the US in search of freedom'. I can only hope that the New Year will allow me to find it."}, "isHosted": false}, {"id": "theguardian/2000/jan/04/features11.g2", "type": "article", "sectionId": "global", "sectionName": "Global", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-04T01:16:27Z", "webTitle": "999", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/jan/04/features11.g2", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/theguardian/2000/jan/04/features11.g2", "fields": {"bodyText": "Where's the fire?

Tall, bearded, capable, with a Robinson Crusoe-style golden earring, he seems like a man who would thrive in the sort of conditions that would leave most of us floundering. He looks more like a castaway than Oliver Reed ever did, even in the mundane surroundings of Gloucester station where we arrange to meet. But whether he will make entertaining, popular television is another matter - he's more Open University than Changing Rooms. Jowers and his wife Sheila are among a group of 36 men, women and children whom the BBC has shipped out to the deserted Scottish island of Taransay for a year to take part in Castaway 2000 - a television series which can be seen either as 'a unique, social experiment', as the BBC describes it, or the latest in a long line of fly-on-the-wall 'docusoaps' with a strong weather twist, depending on your point of view. Last week, while the rest of us were lying low, recovering from Christmas and making final plans for millennium celebrations, the fledgling islanders arrived at their new home, welcomed by winds of 140mph which blew off the roof of one of the sleeping quarters. Jowers, I imagine, leapt unthinkingly to the rescue, organising alternative arrangements and fixing the damage. After months of intensive interviews, tests and survival exercises, the TV production team thinks Jowers could become the father figure in the community, pivotal to its survival. After a couple of hours with him, I think they're probably right. Until last week, the Jowers lived an industrious, slightly alternative, Good Life existence in the Gloucestershire village of Westbury-on-Severn. Sheila, 51, quietly spoken and darkly pretty, worked as a teacher in art and design at the Royal Forest of Dean College; Peter, 52, was employed in the school of politics at the University of Western England, specialising in development, environmental policy, ecology and sustainable futures. They lived with three other families in Adsett Court, a beautiful 16-acre estate not far from the banks of the River Severn which they bought collectively in the 70s; they grew their own vegetables, kept chickens and converted their home from the outbuildings surrounding the gracious main house. Together they ran a local arts organisation and festival. Their three daughters, Mehalah, 23, Jessie, 21 and Henrietta, 19, had all left home to go to university, and they were beginning to consider starting a new adventure together. 'I was thinking of buying a hill farm,' says Peter, who grew up on a smallholding on the Island of Mersea in Essex. 'I want to spend my last 25 years on a hill looking at sheep and planting hedges.' Then, last February, they noticed a small article about an opportunity to spend a year on a deserted Hebridean island. 'I thought, God that sounds wonderful,' says Sheila. They wrote a letter and barely gave it another thought, then in June she received a call inviting them to attend interviews at a Bristol hotel. There was psychological and psychometric testing, and a week of survival exercises in the Welsh mountains, orienteering, white water rafting and killing chickens for supper (not unlike the Jowers' family camping holidays, according to Peter). Then came confirmation that they were among those selected to take part in the experiment. They were delighted, but Peter was unsurprised. 'I always felt we would. We had gone with a suck-it-and-see attitude,' says Peter, whose self-confidence could put a few noses out of joint on the island. 'Because of the life I've led there was nothing that seemed difficult at all. I enjoyed it very much. I think it gave us both a great deal of confidence. It made us realise we have some skills, that we could cope with different situations.' But what makes anyone want to give up a year of their lives to spend it with strangers on an overgrazed island without trees, abandoned by its own inhabitants 30 years ago? (Even the puffins have disappeared, killed by mink which escaped from neighbouring Harris.) 'What appealed to me was to be somewhere totally different and to be in touch with the elements,' says Sheila. 'Other people are amazed that anyone should want to go and spend time in a windswept wet place, but I love the idea of the changing light and the wind and the sky. To get to know it in depth, the darkness, no roads, no cars. 'I was very excited and pleased [to be chosen], but that night I suddenly had doubts. How can I really walk out for a year - from my family, from the children?' Each member of the community is allowed only two visitors on one weekend for the whole year; there are no telephones, no email - only letters every two weeks and a VHF radio for emergencies. The next morning she told Henrietta, their youngest, she had decided she couldn't do it. Her daughters persuaded her to go but she's still worried that her eldest girl, who has fallen in love, will get married while she's away. 'We've forbidden them to do anything drastic.' Peter's key worry is how the group will get on. There's already been tension and disagreement between them - and that's before they even set foot on Scottish soil. (Jowers, it turns out, intervened and managed with some skill to resolve the dispute.) 'My experience of 36 people is that we will have to resolve some conflicts. There's bound to be romance (there are seven single men and seven single women among the group), but I think it will be problematical. It will be very intense. Anything could happen on that front.' The Jowers have other reservations too - they don't mind killing chickens, digging compost toilets and withstanding 140mph winds, but they are concerned how it will all be interpreted in a television series. They don't watch TV themselves, but having applied to take part in the project, they made a point of watching an episode of Paddington Green, which is made by the same production company, Lion Television. 'The first question we asked was, 'Are we just puppets on the editing floor?'' says Peter. The producers managed to reassure them - but no matter how worthy the production company's intentions, it seems obvious that a good bust-up, a nervous breakdown or an illicit relationship make 'better telly' than a harmonious, successful sociological experiment. Executive producer Jeremy Mills rejects any suggestion that the project is little more than a bigger and better docusoap in the tradition of Hotel, Paddington Green, Airport and Children's Hospital, all of which he has been involved with. 'What is a docusoap? It has become a pejorative term to encompass a whole range of documentaries,' he says. 'The only common thing is you take a number of people and you follow their stories over a number of weeks. Castaway 2000 is a completely different project altogether.' He argues it is less entertainment than a scientific experiment, (though there must be a pretty sizeable entertainment factor to justify the \u00a32m-plus budget). The first four films, Mills says, bear no resemblance to a docusoap - they cover the selection process showing viewers how and why the panel of experts, including the likes of Lucy Irvine, herself a former castaway, former SAS survival expert Lofty Wiseman and psychologist Cynthia McVey, chose those taking part in the project. (Importantly, although the television producers were allowed a vote on who would go and who wouldn't, it was ultimately the experts' decision.) But what about the larger-than-life characters that usually steal the show? Who's going to be Taransay's answer to Maureen from Driving School? 'The one thing we did say in this whole thing was that we would not go for extremes,' says Mills. 'It would be very easy and cheap quick-fix entertainment to have a couple of larger than life figures but we didn't want to do that. These days you can turn up in a street, shout 'we want someone to be filmed' and you will get people coming out of their doors to take part. But they are usually the wrong people. We've gone for people in the middle range. Three of the most interesting people on the island are people who did not want to be filmed.' Peter and Sheila Jowers are nothing like the normal docusoap fodder. They are interesting people who are genuinely interested in creating an alternative community for the 21st century, rather than enjoying 15 minutes of fame. Who knows, it might even make interesting television. \u0095 The first of four Castaway 2000 programmes is due to be broadcast January 18 on BBC1 at 9.30pm.

Trek through the Amazon rainforest, go white-water rafting on the Zambezi - or is horse-riding in Mongolia more your thing? Or perhaps an encounter with the 'real' Cuba the lazy tourists never see - on a bike? No wonder offbeat 'challenges', arduous and expensive though they are, have claimed the smart holiday slot. They offer a unique feel-good factor: apart from a registration fee of around \u00a3200, they're free - if you can persuade friends and colleagues to sign up for a sponsorship package of at least \u00a32,500. Two thirds of this goes to charity; the rest pays for your trip. With your new year resolution to adopt a less indulgent lifestyle wavering in the face of the January sales, there's never been a cannier moment for charities to pitch their fundraising holidays. Numbed by winter desolation, thousands of us will be sending off for brochures, offering adventures which cunningly mix altruism with exoticism. Packed with jazzy photos, cool prose and 24-hour enquiry hotlines, these brochures are as seductive as those of the big tour operators - except that the word 'holiday' is taboo. Though the number of trips is limited, exclusive destinations are added every year: the Inca trail in Peru has to be next summer's plum choice. Your friends and workmates will be anything but bored with your anecdotes and snaps - and impressed that you've raised at least \u00a31,500 for one of the 40 or so charities that run sponsored events. Indeed, the brochures are almost too successful: it's the lure of faraway places, the chance of moving through picturesque landscapes, meeting remote tribes and seeing ecological rarities that attracts customers. 'I don't think people who do this sort of thing are driven by a particular cause. The charity is secondary to the challenge,' says John Scourse of Guide Dogs for the Blind. Even so, in the post-trip euphoria, only a curmudgeonly colleague would dare to mutter that while you have indeed raised an impressive amount for a good cause, you've managed to get a 10-day freebie out of it - funded by sponsors who might not have been so generous had they realised this was part of the deal. Challenge holidays were the charity world's big idea of the 90s, and chimed brilliantly with the mood of the decade: don't feel guilty about a form of fundraising that's got a built-in bonus for the participants, who work hard to raise the cash and commit themselves to weeks of fitness training for the journey. But there are growing concerns that it's not always made clear to backers that only two thirds of the money goes to a good cause. It's even less in some cases: Mencap will get just over half of the proceeds of a cycle ride in Costa Rica this year. Airfares, hotels, food, guides and assistance for the cyclists will absorb an alarming 45% of the money raised. Mencap's Sarah Joseph says it's the first time they've been to Costa Rica, and setting up a new destination is costly. Even so, she agrees they've reached the limit with 45%. The Institute of Charity Fund Managers is so worried about challenges that it is drafting a code of practice to allay public misgivings about an idea that's brought a cash bonanza to many less well-known causes, and attracted younger volunteers to organisations that depend on declining numbers of mostly ageing helpers. Ironically, the code will be launched just as some charities are forecasting that the popularity of challenge trips will peak in the next year or two. 'There is a need for a code, so that nobody can be under any illusion about how a trip is financed,' says Janet South, who chairs the working party compiling the guidelines. Though most organisations tell participants to spell out how the scheme works to their sponsors, 'there is a chance of a donor saying to a participant, 'Hang on. You're having the holiday of a lifetime at my expense.'' The code will also advise charity officials, who insist that they need groups of 80 or 100 to make a sufficient profit, to consider the damage big numbers could cause in environmentally sensitive areas. It will also suggest that charities should pay for projects to help local people, so they're giving something back to the third world destinations they use. Many blameless charities already do all of this, but to forestall criticism are keen to explain themselves. After all, they have a lot to lose. Take Sense, the National Deafblind and Rubella Association. The chances are you haven't heard of it, as Stephen Bromberg, head of communications, admits. There are about 23,000 cases of this double disability in the UK. Because this is a relatively low number, says Bromberg, 'We're not a glamorous cause like cancer or homelessness.' Two years ago, Sense decided to join the new wave of fundraising, and started with a trek to Nepal. It was instantly successful. 'So far, we've made close to \u00a31m net profit. That's money we wouldn't normally see.' No criticisms have been made of Sense, but Bromberg says they have to be totally upfront about what is involved. He's defensive about the effort involved: participants 'are climbing mountains, trekking over heavy terrain. It's not an endurance test, but it's not a holiday either.' Of course, charities face a dilemma here. If the hike, canoe journey or horseback trek was too arduous, there would be few takers. And if they dwelt on the poverty of rural Vietnam or Morocco rather than the friendliness of villagers, those on challenge trips would feel like guilty intruders. But it is all presented in the context of wonderful scenery and exciting adventure. Cuba, one of the first big successes, illustrates the difficulty of what happens when a once-exotic destination becomes too popular. 'We became famous for our Cycle Cuba programme in 1998,' says Mark Astira of the National Deaf Children's Society. The charity has taken 700 people there, making a significant net profit of \u00a3750,000 in an annual income of \u00a33m. However, challenge-takers form a fickle segment of the travel market: they want to be wooed with new alluring places every season. 'It's revolutionised our organisation, but I don't think there's any more growth in it. We're stuck on about 400 people this year.' The word is the same from Guide Dogs for the Blind, where John Scourse says: 'We're planning for challenge events to peak in 2001. Our gut feeling is that there's got to be a limit to this one.' The challenge bubble is under pressure from two sides. South agrees that exotic destinations lose their rarity value when too many charities go there. She also says sponsors will become weary. 'Early on, it's a novelty. But when the same person comes back a second time asking you to be a sponsor; or when the fifth person knocks on your door with the same request...' Astira completes the picture: 'There's nothing like a charity for murdering a good idea,' he says ruefully. It's a motto the multimillion world of fundraising would do well to remember. So thinking caps on, while the rest of us prepare to put our hands into our pockets - yet again."}, "isHosted": false}, {"id": "world/2000/jan/04/johngittings", "type": "article", "sectionId": "world", "sectionName": "World news", "webPublicationDate": "2000-01-04T01:16:29Z", "webTitle": "A new horizon fro Dr Ho's palace", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jan/04/johngittings", "apiUrl": "https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2000/jan/04/johngittings", "fields": {"bodyText": "The Jumbo Palace floating restaurant moors in Manila bay, part of casino tycoon Stanley Ho's grand strategy to capture the gambling market in the Philippines.
